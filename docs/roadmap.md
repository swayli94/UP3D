# pyFP3D Development Roadmap
## Active implementation roadmap — track index

**This file (plus the per-track files below) is authoritative for phase status
and gates.** Since 2026-07-15 the phase entries, gate checklists and progress
ledgers live in ONE FILE PER TRACK under [roadmap/](roadmap/) — split **verbatim**
from this file (nothing was reworded in the split). Any reference elsewhere of
the form "roadmap.md Track X / phase entry / ledger" resolves through the per-track bullets:

- **P — solver** — [roadmap/track_p.md](roadmap/track_p.md) — P0–P9 ✓ (P1: only G1.6 open, strict xfail) · P10 ◐ (G10.2/G10.3 ✓, G10.1
  open) · **P11 ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-19** (user-directed, opened+closed same day; sphere leg): curved wall elements measured NEGATIVE (medium
  11.56%→11.33% = the G1.4 oracle ceiling; superparametric O(h) risk fired) and **G1.6 RE-ATTRIBUTED** —
  the order collapse was the fixed-bulk sweep floor (far-only refinement: 3.17×, order 1.89) and 11.6% ≈ intrinsic P1 capability at
  h=0.08 (structured control ~2nd order with flat facets); G1.6 xfail stays, route fork (Option C re-spec / P2 wall layer / accept) =

  the probe path was 4.5%/4.3% below). G14.7 re-specced at close from the probe G8.2 locks to the level-set oracle (the +4.85% cl_KJ move
  is the finding — 69% of P9's 0.019 gap was Kutta-estimator bias)
- **M — meshing** — [roadmap/track_m.md](roadmap/track_m.md) — M0, M1(+M1b), M2, M3, M4, M5 ✓ — **M2 ✓ (solver leg closed by B9

  not FD noise) ⇒ the LS Newton is a **quasi**-Newton in 3-D; **R is untouched so every converged state and gate number stands**;
  RECORDED not fixed, the kernel fix is its own phase. Plus C2/C3 backported to the conforming Newton, reader C4/C5 (silently dropped
  surface groups ⇒ Γ(root) silently pinned to 0), C6/C7/P1/T1/T2/F0, 17/17 docs findings dispositioned, and the close-out ritual extended
  to five surfaces + a backport check. No `pyfp3d/` numerics change)

[design.md](design.md) remains the design reference for equations, numerics and
architecture; Track B numerics live in [design_track_b.md](design_track_b.md)
(supersedes DN1). Evidence for closed phases: [demo_report.md](demo_report.md)
(index) + [demo_report/](demo_report/) (per track). Human-readable status
snapshot + document map: [overview.md](overview.md). Analysis/review reports
(non-normative): [analysis/](analysis/).
(`docs/discussion_notes/` — the DN1–DN6 design-note sources and the PLAN.md
integration view — was deleted 2026-07-14, commit 0e4895a; historical copies via
`git show 8aa4aee:docs/discussion_notes/<file>`.)

**Gate-ID / renumbering conventions.** Gate IDs are `G<phase>.<n>` (Track V:
`GV<phase>.<n>`; Track A: `GA<phase>.<n>`). Phases were renumbered three times on Track P (2026-07-08, then
twice on 2026-07-11) and three times on Track B (twice on 2026-07-12, once on
2026-07-13); documents dated
before those days use the then-current IDs. The authoritative mapping notes are
kept verbatim inside the affected phase entries in the track files.

## 0. Working rules

- A phase is complete only when its medium-mesh gate passes and the full coarse regression suite stays green.
- After any kernel change, run `pytest tests/test_v0_freestream.py` before any broader validation.
- Use SciPy/PyAMG for linear algebra, keep Numba kernels SoA-only, and validate against full-potential references before Euler.
- Keep state in git plus this file; update the progress ledger when a gate closes.
- Every visual gate must have a headless path: generate PNG/CSV artifacts by script (no GUI-only checks).

## 0.1 Headless Linux feasibility and tooling policy

The current plan is feasible on Linux without a graphical desktop, with one constraint:
all visualization checks must be script-driven and artifact-based.

Required execution modes:
- Mesh generation/inspection: use `gmsh` CLI (`-2/-3`, `-format msh4`) and scriptable quality reports.
- Solver/testing: run via `pytest` and Python CLIs only.
- Visualization artifacts: prefer `matplotlib` for plots and `pyvista` off-screen rendering; use `pvpython`/`pvbatch` if ParaView is installed headless.
- CI compatibility: every gate that references a figure should accept generated PNG + numeric CSV summary as evidence.

Non-goals for v1.0:
- No dependency on interactive ParaView GUI for gate closure.

## Agent Workflow Bindings

- **agent-rules.md** (kept < 30 lines): points to design.md + this file, states
  the current phase, the hard rules from §0, and "do not edit files under
  `cases/reference_data/`".
- **Session protocol:** per work item — plan mode first (Claude reads the
      relevant design.md sections + this plan's phase entry, proposes an
  implementation plan, human review), then implement, then gates, then commit.
- **Skill sedimentation checkpoints:** end of P1 and end of P2, distill
  recurring numba pitfalls and the test-first procedure observed so far into
  `.claude/skills/fp3d-dev/SKILL.md`. Do not write the skill before P1 —
  capture real failure modes, not anticipated ones.
- **Subagents (from P4 onward):**
  - `validation-runner` (read-only + bash): runs the full gate suite,
    returns a residual/convergence summary table — keeps hundreds of lines of
    pytest output out of the main context.
  - `derivation-checker` (read-only): cross-checks kernel implementations
      against design.md §2–§6 formulas; invoked before closing P4 and P7.
- **Reference data discipline:** digitized FP reference Cp/shock data lives
  in `cases/reference_data/` with provenance notes (source figure, digitizing
  method); gates compare against these files, never against numbers embedded
  in test code.

## Progress ledger

Moved per-track (2026-07-15): each `roadmap/track_*.md` ends with its own
"Progress ledger" section (status legend: ✓ closed · ◐ partially closed /
in progress · ☐ open or not started · ⊘ shelved).
