## Track B — Level-set embedded wake (designed 2026-07-07; IN PROGRESS — B1 ✓ B2 ✓ B3 ✓ B4 ✓ B5 ✓ B7 ✓; B6 ◐ since 2026-07-12: coarse gate met + LS Newton delivered, medium closure open; **B8 ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-14 characterized-not-cured (user-arbitrated; both constraint-side cures measured negative; B9 unblocked)**; **B11 ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-14 — LS-path infrastructure: unified post-processing + GMRES/AMG scaling (the deferred §5.3 escape from the splu wall), NEW appended after B10**; **B12 ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-14 — lagged-LU direct-reuse for LS Newton (M6 medium Newton 2.18× via 1 factorization vs 7), NEW appended after B11**; **B13 ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-14 — lagged-LU on the Picard outer loop (M6 medium lifting 6.55× 447.6→68.3 s, end-to-end ~3× ~330→112 s)**; **B14 ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-17 — Schur-eliminated-aux + AMG structural preconditioner (`precond="schur"`); the A1 precond bottleneck GONE (M6 medium M0.84 43.6% → 2.6%, ramp 1.43× / subsonic 2.08×), γ = the committed GB15.4; fine-scale route remains the unbuilt designed use-case**; **B15 ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-15 — LS Newton transonic ramp + N5 freeze-selection: the Picard shock plateau is GONE (M6 medium M0.84 2304.7 s bounded-stall → 657 s all-levels-converged, 3.5×; NACA coarse M0.80 5.6× and strict), plus FOUR errata proving the conforming N5 recipe is not mechanically portable**; **B9 ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-17 (RE-SPEC'D, user-approved) — wing-body cross-model validation: LS (Picard) + conforming (NEW capability, Newton) AGREE to 0.4%/0.6% at medium M0.5; GB9.4 fuselage-lift XFAIL ⇒ G1.6 fuselage-Cp error; LS Newton diverges on the wing-body = the `neumann` far-field blockage, not the solver**; **B16 ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-18 (churn fix; lift-convergence OPEN) — LS Newton far-field BC generalisation: the wing-body churn is a near-singular far-field aux block (cond1 O(1e19), the 8 rows |R|≈84 reproduced), `farfield_aux="pin"` (default) drops it to 8.7e6 ⇒ freestream Newton reaches res 5.88e-14 / 0 limited at COARSE (lift matches conforming 0.1%) where legacy churns at 7.95; neumann byte-identical. ★★ BUT GB16.4 XFAIL — the MEDIUM Newton-pin STALLS at res 7e-6, lift 22% below Picard/conforming (which agree, B9's 0.4%); the {Newton,Picard,conforming} triangle does not close ⇒ UNRESOLVED non-convergence, open follow-up (**RESOLVED by B17**)**; **B17 ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-18 (NEW, user-directed; resolves GB16.4) — the far-field pin must carry jump=γ, not 0: B16's freestream jump=0 REMOVED the outflow wake circulation (a BC-modelling error, NOT a non-convergence — an independent Picard-pin converges to the same medium 0.169 the Newton-pin "stalls" at); `farfield_aux="pin_gamma"` (new default, both solvers) closes the triangle MONOTONE to conforming (coarse 0.2087, medium 0.2117 Picard/0.2115 Newton); vortex brackets from +2.5%; B9 coarse-12.8% erratum'd as far-field contamination**; **B18 ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-18 (NEW, user-directed; executes the GB16.6 debt) — wing-body transonic (M0.84): CONFORMING reaches it (coarse M0.84 0.2617, medium M0.79 0.2579, clean cl(M) rise), LEVEL-SET is junction-limited (coarse ~M0.575, medium dies ~M0.5 — the G1.6/GB9.4 junction pocket WORSENS with refinement, closed-negative); no common transonic Mach at medium so cross-model stays M0.5 (2.6%); GB18.1 PASS + GB18.2–5 RECORDED; no pyfp3d/ change** — B10 = curved wake shelved)

Deliverable: `wake/` — a level-set wake representation + multivalued (CutFEM-style)
elements + implicit Kutta (TE duplication + wake least-squares condition; penalty
Kutta demoted to an optional diagnostic — design_track_b.md D2), replacing the
conforming embedded wake sheet + master–slave Γ elimination.
**Purpose (user-arbitrated 2026-07-11): mesh/geometry workflow capability** —
no pre-embedded wake surface, α sweeps without remeshing, blunt-TE anchoring,
multi-wake / wake–fuselage intersections for M2, structural elimination of the
st133-class Kutta-probe failures. NOT solver speed: the original
kill-the-Γ-secant efficiency motivation is obsolete post-P8 Newton
(design_track_b.md §1); efficiency criteria below are non-regression guards only.
Design record: DN1 (historical; `discussion_notes/` deleted 2026-07-14 —
`git show 8aa4aee:docs/discussion_notes/20260707_1505_levelset_wake_design.md`),
superseded by design_track_b.md. **Status (2026-07-12): B1 + B2 + B3 + B4 CLOSED.**
The level-set path now produces LIFT with an implicit Kutta (no Γ secant, no
master–slave Γ): Γ matches the conforming solver **within 1% on the same mesh**
at M=0 and M=0.5, cl lands inside the committed [PG, KT] bracket, and the
**wake-free** M3 mesh (no `wake` tag at all) reproduces the embedded-mesh
circulation to 0.3% — the workflow payoff. **★ The B4 finding (design_track_b.md
§9):** the wake LS is STRUCTURALLY blind to a constant jump (Σ_c ∇N_c = ∇(1) = 0
⇒ residual identically zero, measured 1.9e-16), so "g₂ IS the discrete Kutta" is
FALSE — Γ needs its own condition. B4 supplies it: the **nonlinear TE
pressure-equality (Bernoulli) Kutta** |q_u|² = |q_l|², factorized exactly as
(q_u+q_l)·(q_u−q_l) = 0 and linearized by freezing the mean, with q recovered on
the TE's **WALL-ADJACENT** upper/lower control volumes. **B5 closed
2026-07-12 — far-field verdict: option a (Dirichlet+vortex) stays the default**
(domain-robust to <1%; the López Neumann outlet truncates O(Γ/R) and needs a
2–4× larger domain; M6 leg folded into B7). Next = B6 (transonic) / B7
(M6 3D).
**Numerics reference (2026-07-11):** [design_track_b.md](../design_track_b.md) —
theory/implementation analysis cross-checked against the López dissertation;
supersedes DN1 as the Track B numerics spec (key deltas: 3D wake BC uses the
López g₁+g₂ two-component LS form, NOT the Núñez full-vector form; Kutta is
implicit via TE duplication + the wake LS condition, penalty demoted to
optional; on-wake nodes need the ε side-shift DN1 missed). Gate re-specs were
**user-arbitrated 2026-07-11 and merged into the phase entries below** (B3 re-spec;
B5 far-field A/B NEW; B4 re-anchored post-P4-erratum, medium at M0.7875;
B7 M6 3D gate NEW); design_track_b.md §7 is the arbitration record.


### B1 — Level-set wake + cut-element identification ✓ (closed 2026-07-11)
**Deliverable:** Level-set wake + cut-element identification (`wake/levelset.py`, `wake/cut_elements.py`)
**Gate (dual-mesh: M0/M1 wake-embedded + M3/M4 wake-free):**
- [x] **CLOSED 2026-07-11** (`tests/test_b1_cut_elements.py`, 34 passed, 2.5D coarse+medium of both families + 3D M6 of both families): (a) M0 embedded — every conforming sheet node ε-shifted "+" (D4 stress test at scale), census **exactly** == `cut_wake`'s minus-side element star (`cut_elems ∪ te_lower_elems`, element-by-element), TE nodes == `wc.te_nodes`; (b) M3 wake-free — generic cuts, gap-free corridor TE→far field at α=0 AND after `update_direction` to α=4° **on the same mesh**; (c) **M1/M4 ONERA M6 (3D)** — swept TE polyline: census is a strict **superset** of the conforming minus-star (0 missing, +2.9% extras, all tip-edge straddlers — the sheet's tip edge conforms to element edges on the M1 mesh but passes THROUGH elements for the level set; expected and explained), spanwise clip verified (nothing cut wholly outboard of the tip); M4 wake-free — same census structure with no `wake` tag, spanwise-gap-free sheet, α re-aim 0°→3.06° on the same mesh. Delivered: TE-**polyline** ruled level set (D9) with an **oblique (v, d̂, n̂) frame** — ★ a swept TE is not perpendicular to the wake direction, so an orthogonal span projection leaks the downstream distance into the spanwise coordinate and wrongly clips ~60% of the true M6 cut set (measured, then fixed; regression-pinned); **spanwise clip** (crossings must satisfy 0 ≤ q ≤ span_length — outboard of the tip the sheet has ended, Γ(tip)=0; without it the level set re-creates P5's far-field branch-ray artifact); downstream-crossing test (excludes the ahead-of-LE sign-change region); `te_lower_elems` recorded for B2's López-fig-3.6c aux assignment

### B2 — Multivalued FE assembly ✓ (closed 2026-07-11)
**Deliverable:** Multivalued FE assembly (`wake/multivalued.py::MultivaluedOperator`, `kernels/cut_assembly.py`; `solve/picard_ls.py::solve_multivalued_laplace` non-lifting driver — parallel to the conforming path, which stays byte-untouched)
**Gates (dual-mesh):**
- [x] **CLOSED 2026-07-11** (`tests/test_b2_multivalued.py`, 17 passed on coarse+medium of both 2.5D families and 3D M6 coarse of both families; some medium/M6 parametrizations skip in CI where the meshes are gitignored). Key design: a cut element is the SAME P1 element matrix assembled twice with `dofs_upper`/`dofs_lower`, expressed as a sparse **redirection** of the single-valued matrix — on a cut element the entries whose two nodes are on OPPOSITE sides move their column main(b)→aux(b) (`multivalued_redirection_coo`); everything else is byte-identical to `PicardOperator.assemble_matrix()`. Aux rows carry the B2 **continuity ("weld") closure** aux_k = main_j (`continuity_closure_coo`), which makes the extended (n_total = n_main + n_ext) system reduce EXACTLY to the single-valued one — proven directly (`test_extended_matrix_folds_to_stiffness`: folding aux→main recovers the stiffness matrix to 1e-13). The extended matrix is structurally nonsymmetric (weld rows), solved by sparse-direct LU (`spsolve`); GMRES+AMG is the B3+ scaling path (design_track_b.md §5.3). B3 replaces the weld block with the g₁+g₂ wake LS (implicit Kutta), at which point [φ] becomes nonzero.
- [x] V0 freestream (φ = U·x, full Dirichlet) < 1e−12 on the cut mesh: 2.5D M0/M3 α=0 and α=4° = **0.0** (exact linear field); 3D M6 M1/M4 = **1.1e−14 / 3.4e−14**
- [x] V1 MMS slope ≥ 1.9: cube cut in generic position (8° tilted half-plane), 3-level slope **1.94**
- [x] Laplace α = 0 gives cl ≈ 0: TE jump = 0 (the weld forbids a jump) ⇒ cl_KJ = 0, and the main potential matches the single-valued `solve_laplace` oracle to **~3e−11** — on both mesh types (dual-mesh rule)

### B3 — Lifting solve with implicit Kutta ✓ (closed 2026-07-12)
**Deliverable:** Lifting solve with **implicit Kutta** — no Γ secant, no master–slave Γ constraint: the TE jump is carried by the multivalued aux DOFs, the g₁+g₂ wake LS convects it downstream, and its VALUE is set by B4's nonlinear TE pressure-equality Kutta. Γ is a RESULT. `kernels/cut_assembly.py` (`mass_conservation_coo` with per-side ρ per D10, `wake_ls_coo`, `te_kutta_coo`), `wake/multivalued.py` (`closure="wake_ls"`, side potentials/densities, TE control volumes), `solve/picard_ls.py::solve_multivalued_lifting`. Far field = Dirichlet freestream + vortex on the **MAIN** DOFs, aux **FREE**.
**Gates (dual-mesh) — `tests/test_b3_lifting.py`, 6 passed:**
- [x] **V3 M0.5 α=2°: cl inside the committed [PG, KT] bracket** — cl_KJ **0.2828** (medium) inside [PG 0.2788, KT 0.2919], read from `cases/reference_data/naca0012_m05/cl_reference.csv` (the same file the conforming G3.2 gate reads). Holds on BOTH the wake-embedded M0 family and the **wake-free M3** family.
- [x] **Same-mesh A/B vs conforming** (only possible on the embedded family): Γ within **0.1–0.7%** at M=0 and M=0.5, coarse/medium/fine (0.1177/0.1191/0.1197 vs 0.1175/0.1200/0.1202). *The old "within 1% same-mesh" clause — retired on 2026-07-12 as unmeetable — is in fact MET, now that B4 supplies a real Kutta.*
- [x] **Wake-free M3 mesh** (no `wake` tag, generic cuts — the actual workflow form): Γ within **0.3%** of the embedded-mesh result; medium cl inside [PG, KT]. *(M3 coarse cl 0.2773 sits 0.5% under the PG edge — a coarse-mesh accuracy artifact; the gate lives on medium per hard rule 2.)*
- [x] Γ emerges (no outer Γ loop) and the wake jump is CONVECTED, not decaying (pinned: far-field aux DOFs must stay free)

### B4 — TE control-volume / implicit-Kutta re-derivation ✓ (NEW + closed 2026-07-12, user-directed)
**The B3 blocker and its fix (design_track_b.md §9).** Two structural facts:
**(1) The wake LS CANNOT pin Γ.** Its residual is identically zero for any spatially-constant jump, because Σ_c ∇N_c = ∇(Σ_c N_c) = ∇(1) = 0 (partition of unity) — measured **1.9e-16**. ⇒ design_track_b.md §2.3/D2's "the g₂ on the TE-adjacent wake element IS the discrete Kutta condition" is **FALSE and retired**; the López dissertation has no explicit Kutta anywhere ("Kutta" never appears in its method chapter).
**(2) Γ was therefore pinned by a single, WRONG equation** — the TE aux row (lower-side mass conservation), whose control volume is up/down asymmetric on a symmetric airfoil (TE fan 9 upper / 6 lower / 3 cut, because the ε shift sends every on-sheet node "+"). It over-circulated **+42%** (Γ → 0.168 vs 0.120), mesh-convergently.
**★ Deliverable — the nonlinear TE pressure-equality (Bernoulli) Kutta.** Symmetrizing the control volume is NOT available (the mesh is naturally asymmetric at the TE — user-arbitrated), so the condition is instead a POINTWISE PHYSICAL statement needing no symmetry: |q_u|² = |q_l|², factorized **exactly** as (q_u+q_l)·(q_u−q_l) = 0 and linearized by freezing the mean s̄ = q_u+q_l at the previous iterate — a row that is LINEAR in φ, re-linearized each Picard outer (same cadence as the density lag, no new outer loop), converging to the exact nonlinear condition. It sits on the TE **aux** row; the displaced lower-side mass-conservation entries are re-routed onto the TE **main** row, which then carries the TOTAL (upper+lower) balance — so mass stays conserved and no side is arbitrarily robbed of its equation. **Why it is non-degenerate where g₂ is not:** q_u and q_l are recovered on DIFFERENT element sets, so q_u−q_l is not a jump gradient and does not vanish for a constant jump.
**★ The control volumes must be WALL-ADJACENT** (elements carrying a wall face — the upper/lower body surface at the TE), not the whole element fan: the Kutta condition is about the SURFACE velocities. Measured (Γ, coarse/medium/fine vs conforming 0.1175/0.1200/0.1202): full-fan recovery **0.1407/0.1355/0.1329** (+11–15%, interior and wake elements pollute the average) → wall-adjacent **0.1177/0.1191/0.1197** (**<1%**).
**Interfaces:** `solve_multivalued_lifting(..., te_kutta="pressure")` (default); `te_kutta="mass"` keeps the old B3 row for the before/after contrast. `kernels/cut_assembly.py::te_kutta_coo`, `wake/multivalued.py::{_build_te_control_volumes, te_velocities}`. **The D2 penalty-Kutta fallback is no longer needed** — this route has no penalty weight and no tuning parameter (s̄ is solved for, not calibrated).
**Gates — `tests/test_b4_te_control_volume.py`, 8 passed (~29 s):**
- [x] the wake-LS constant-jump null space is pinned numerically (1.9e-16) — the reason a separate TE condition is structurally required
- [x] the TE control volumes are wall-adjacent (every element carries a wall face)
- [x] the below-TE fan is never cut (the López p.57 ε-shift trap; regression pin)
- [x] **NACA0012 α=2° incompressible: emergent Γ within 5% of conforming** — measured **0.1–0.7%** on coarse and medium; and the old `te_kutta="mass"` row is still >30% out (before/after contrast held honest)
- [x] visual artifact `artifacts/EXPORT_TE_DIAGNOSIS/b4_te_kutta.png` + `summary.csv` (wall-adjacent control volumes + the three Γ-vs-h curves against conforming)

### B5 — Far-field A/B: Dirichlet+vortex vs Neumann outlet ✓ (was B4.5, orig B3.5; NEW 2026-07-11; closed 2026-07-12, user-arbitrated)
**Deliverable:** option a (spherical Dirichlet + vortex on the main DOFs) vs option b (López-style Neumann outlet, no vortex; domain re-calibrated per the dissertation §4.1.4 — note López uses **10²–10⁷ chord** domains vs pyFP3D's 15c) — design_track_b.md §5.4/D7. **Interface:** `solve_multivalued_lifting(farfield="vortex"|"neumann"|"freestream")`; default `"vortex"`.
**Note (2026-07-12):** far-field truncation is **NOT** the B3 over-circulation cause — imposing the conforming true solution's far-field trace as Dirichlet still yields Γ = 0.1721. Confirmed after B4 closed: with B4's correct Kutta, the far-field question decouples cleanly and is purely an O(Γ/R) truncation study.
**Gate:**
- [x] **CLOSED 2026-07-12 — verdict: option a (Dirichlet+vortex) STAYS the default.** López-style domain-size re-calibration on the NACA dual-mesh families (M0 embedded + M3 wake-free), coarse, M0.5 α2°, far-field radius R ∈ {15,30,60,120}c (demo `cases/demo/b4p5_farfield/`, `tests/test_b45_farfield.py` 10 passed). **Measured:** option a is **domain-robust** — Γ within **0.45%** (M0) / **1.09%** (M3) of the truth across 15→120c, and **0.25%** of the conforming solver at 15c; option b truncates the O(Γ/R) point-vortex tail — Γ **−4.07%** below a at 15c, halving each doubling of R (−2.0% at 30c, −0.99% at 60c, −0.50% at 120c), so it meets the B3 ±2% band only at **R ≥ ~30c** and <1% at **R ≥ 60c** (a 2–4× larger domain, 4× the tets at equal near-body h — consistent with why López needs 10²–10⁷c domains); freestream-Dirichlet is the crudest at every R (and DIVERGES on the compact 15c M0). Both mesh families give bit-for-bit the same story. Since the O(Γ/R) truncation is geometry-universal (a 3D wing truncates the same horseshoe tail), this decides the far-field default for the M6 B-path too. **M6 leg folded into B7** (user-arbitrated 2026-07-12): the level-set B-path *solve* on M6 needs the 3D wake-BC machinery that is B7's deliverable — and, separately measured here, the span-uniform option-a vortex without the P5 Γ(z) taper recreates the branch-ray artifact on M6, itself B7 machinery.

### B6 — Transonic + Mach continuation on the level-set path ◐ IN PROGRESS 2026-07-12 (coarse gate ✓; medium = bounded Picard state, isolated fold solution deferred to LS Newton) (was B5, orig B4)
**Deliverable:** Transonic + Mach continuation on the level-set path (~~inherits `damping_theta`~~ — **measured 2026-07-12: the inherited stabilizer does NOT transplant as-is**, see findings below). Delivered so far (design_track_b.md §10): per-side artificial density on the cut elements with a same-side-restricted upstream walk (`MultivaluedOperator.element_rho_tilde`, D10 — subcritically an exact no-op; the M0.80 blow-up cells sit in the pocket ABOVE the airfoil, zero on the wake strip, so the shock machinery is isomorphic to conforming); **supersonic-zone-LOCALIZED damping** (`damping_scope="supersonic"`) — the P4 whole-field θ·diag form is a Jacobi smoother that throttles the smooth global circulation mode, which on the B path is a SOLUTION mode (conforming keeps Γ outside the damped matrix as a secant unknown; measured: Γ crawls 0.0005→0.017 in 160 outers vs undamped convergence in 35); `solve_multivalued_transonic` Mach ramp with **no Γ secant** (a level = one warm-started Picard solve — the st133-class per-station closure failure is structurally impossible); `post/surface_ls.py` (D11 wall Cp + shock extraction on the B path); +9 suite tests (`tests/test_b6_transonic.py`) incl. the two recorded negative results.
**★ Fold findings (2026-07-12, coarse M0.80 α1.25 vs the G8.1 anchors — Newton shock 0.658/cl_p 0.459/Γ≈0.2295; conforming Picard's own committed state is a STALL at Γ 0.1819/shock 0.604):** (1) the **live option-a Γ→far-field-vortex feedback has loop gain > 1 near the fold** — Γ climbs monotonically THROUGH the conforming-Picard value AND the Newton value at flat residual ~5e-5, then blows up (M_max 37); under-relaxation cannot fix monotone gain > 1 (1+ω(λ−1) > 1 ∀ω>0; ω_γ=0.1 measured = slower divergence). (2) the per-level lagged vortex + polish (P5 pattern) measures the outer map g(Γ_ff) = 0.1366→0.2189→0.2884→0.4514: **no fixed point below the isentropic-validity ceiling** ⇒ with a live/lagged vortex this discretization at coarse M0.80 sits PAST the fold — the P8 conforming-MEDIUM phenomenon one mesh earlier (the LS path lifts a few % higher at equal h, see (4)). (3) **the López Neumann outlet (B5 option b, no Γ feedback) removes the loop and CONVERGES to near the Newton solution** on BOTH mesh families (physical, 0 lim/flr, M_max 1.39): M0 embedded Γ 0.2114 (−7.9% of Newton), shock 0.644, cl_p 0.4154; **M3 wake-free Γ 0.2315 (+0.9% of Newton!), shock 0.678, cl_p 0.4556 (−0.7% of Newton 0.459)** — both far closer to the truth than the conforming Picard's own stall (Γ 0.1819 = −21%, shock 0.604, cl_p 0.357); structurally why the dissertation runs all transonic cases on the outlet form. ⇒ **B6 transonic recipe = `farfield="neumann"`** (B5's subsonic option-a default verdict unaffected). (4) ★ **INVERSION — the LS Picard tracks the conforming NEWTON truth to ≤1%; the deviator is the conforming Picard itself.** The raw Picard-vs-Picard gap grows with pocket strength (M0.5 +0.2% / M0.65 +0.5% / M0.70 +4.9% / M0.75 +10.5% coarse; medium M0.70 +7.4%) — but same-mesh conforming NEWTON arbitration shows the conforming PICARD under-circulates by −4.1% (coarse M0.70, Newton Γ 0.1151) / −8.4% (coarse M0.75, Newton 0.1377) / −6.6% (medium M0.70, Newton 0.1190) — the P4-erratum bias (frozen-Γ inner solves + budgeted secant early-stop) quantified at weak shocks — while the LS Picard sits at **+0.6% / +1.0% / +0.25%** of the Newton truth respectively, converging TOWARD it under refinement (no early-stoppable Γ outer exists on the LS path: Γ is a solution mode, converged with the field to residual ~1e-7).
**Gates (dual-mesh; re-anchored 2026-07-11 P4-erratum aware; ★ BASELINE CHANGED 2026-07-12, USER-ARBITRATED: the reference is the same-mesh conforming NEWTON truth, NOT the conforming Picard — the Picard stall under-circulates 4–8% at these shock strengths (finding 4), so it was never a valid A/B target; this aligns the B6 reference with the G8.1 anchor):**
- [x] **coarse M0.80 α1.25° inside the G8.1 Newton-lock bands** with the B6 neumann recipe: **MET** — M0 embedded shock 0.644 / cl_p 0.4154 / Γ 0.2114 (−7.9% of Newton 0.2295); M3 wake-free shock 0.678 / cl_p 0.4556 (−0.7% of Newton 0.459) / Γ 0.2315 (+0.9%); both inside shock 0.658±0.06 and Γ ±10%, physical (0 lim/flr, M_max 1.39). (The conforming Picard itself misses these locks by −21% cl / −0.054 shock — the deprecated baseline.)
- [~] **medium M0.7875** (the G8.1 re-specced case): **PARTIAL — bounded Picard-quality state reached, isolated fold solution deferred to the LS Newton.** With the fold recipe (C=2.0, θ=0.5 localized, dm=0.025 into the fold) the LS neumann solve on M0 embedded stays BOUNDED and physical at every level (M_max 1.44 vs Newton 1.404, **0 limited / 0 floored**, shock captured) — but it STALLS at Γ 0.2146, **−18.8% of the same-mesh conforming Newton truth 0.2643**, residual parked at ~5e-6. This is the FP non-uniqueness fold: a Picard method — conforming OR level-set — does not reach the isolated solution here (exactly why G8.1 re-specced the *conforming* path to Newton locks at medium; P4-erratum / P8 fold record), and the heavier dissipation needed to keep the finer-mesh shock bounded depresses the lift further. Earlier attempt with the coarse recipe (C=1.5, θ=0.2) **diverged** (M_max 60, 1103 limited) — the medium shock needs more dissipation than coarse. ⇒ the quantitative medium gate needs the **LS Newton** (post-B6 re-derivation, design_track_b.md §5.5, explicitly deferred). The dm=0.025 M3 wake-free medium leg is not yet measured (timed out behind M0).
- [x] **same-mesh A/B vs the conforming NEWTON solution within 2%** (re-baselined): **MET** where both converge — LS Picard is +0.5% (coarse M0.65) / +0.6% (M0.70) / +1.0% (M0.75) / +0.25% (medium M0.70) of the Newton Γ, and −7.9%/+0.9% (M0/M3 coarse M0.80, the fold, Picard-quality band). The old "Picard-vs-Picard ±2%" reading is retired (measured the conforming stall bias, not an LS error).
- [x] fold discipline applies (per-mesh locks, no cross-mesh convergence claims) — enforced: coarse M0.80 and medium M0.7875 are separate anchors, the dual-mesh spread widens at the fold (M0/M3 straddle Newton) and is reported per mesh, never as a convergence claim.

**★ B6-Newton (post-B6 re-derivation, design_track_b.md §5.5/§10.6; 2026-07-12) — the LS Newton that the medium fold needs.** `solve/newton_ls.py::solve_multivalued_newton`: exact Jacobian = Picard matrix + per-side Terms 2/3 (P7 sensitivities through the DOF indirection) + the EXACT quadratic TE-Kutta derivative; wake-LS rows linear (no correction); no Γ DOF (no Woodbury); nonsymmetric → splu. **FD-verified 1.3e-9** (`tests/test_b6_newton.py`; the Terms-2/3 row-map — drop non-TE aux, reroute TE aux → TE main — was FD-caught at 1e-4 before the fix). **★ Reaches machine-converged, terminal-QUADRATIC discrete fold solutions (0 lim/flr) where the Picard only stalled:** coarse M0.80 M0 |R| 9.4e-13 Γ 0.2124 (−7.4% of conforming Newton) / M3 3.2e-11 Γ 0.2322 (+1.2%); **medium M0.7875 M3 wake-free (the workflow mesh) |R| 1.5e-12 Γ 0.2292** — the fold is a genuine discrete solution on the B path, closing the "is it a solution?" question the Picard stall left open. **Two honest gaps remain (recorded):** (1) M0-embedded medium live-Newton limit-cycles at |R|~3e-6 (bounded/physical but not machine-converged) — the P8/N5 near-tie churn in LS form; fix = wire in the N5 frozen-selection/refresh (§5.5 says it transplants, interface `freeze` reserved); (2) the converged LS fold lift sits ~13% below the conforming-Newton truth at medium (a real discretization difference, both machine-converged) — apportionment (B5 neumann O(Γ/R) −4% vs cut-integration O(h) vs artificial-density mesh-dependence) is the recorded next investigation (candidate: a vortex-far-field LS Newton + C-sweep). ⇒ B6 stays IN PROGRESS: coarse gate met, LS Newton delivered + fold reachable, medium quantitative closure needs those two items.

**Measured (M1 wake-embedded / M4 wake-free; solve 22.7 / 18.4 min coarse):**

| | M1 embedded | M4 wake-free | P5 conforming Picard | P8 conforming **Newton** |
|---|---|---|---|---|

† M_max re-read 2026-07-14 with the honest `element_mach2(mixed_plain="main")`
(default since the B8-backlog flip): **M1 1.453 (side) → 1.392 (main)** — the
committed 1.453 was itself a beyond-tip mixed-plain artifact cell (honest value
closer to P5's conforming 1.398); M4 and both 2.5D B6 states are **bit-identical**
under either reading. Gate bands unchanged. Artifact:
`cases/demo/b8_tip_taper_ls/results/mmax_reread.csv` (+ `run_b8_mmax_reread.py`).

**★ Finding 1 — the B6 lift INVERSION reproduces in 3D, on the first try.** Gated against the conforming **Newton** truth (the B6 user-arbitrated baseline, not the conforming Picard), the level-set Picard lands **+2.7% (M1) / +0.7% (M4)** of cl_KJ 0.2692 — while the conforming Picard (P5) sits **−8.6%** below it. This is the same structure B6 measured in 2D and for the same reason: the LS path has **no early-stoppable Γ outer** (the implicit Kutta makes Γ a solution mode converged with the field), whereas the conforming Picard's frozen-Γ inner solves + budgeted per-station secant under-circulate (the P4-erratum bias; P8 independently measured it at +7.9% for M6 medium). Gating B7's lift on P5 would have *penalised the B path for being closer to the truth* — hence the Newton anchor. Note the **wake-free workflow mesh (M4) is the more accurate of the two**, which is the outcome Track B exists to deliver.

**★ Finding 2 — the 3D far field: `farfield="neumann"`, and the P5 Γ(z) taper is NOT needed on the B path.** The B-path vortex (`picard_ls._farfield_main`) is a **span-uniform** 2D point vortex whose branch cut is the ray y=0, x>0 *at every z*. On M6 that is wrong in two independent, separately-measured ways (demo `farfield_decision.png`; gated `test_farfield_vortex_is_contraindicated_in_3d`), both showing up as a spurious near-sonic spot at the **outlet, where the sheet leaves the domain** (max local Mach there, M∞ 0.5):
  - **(a) non-coplanarity** — the α-aimed sheet has climbed to y ≈ x·tan α ≈ 0.5 by the outlet, far off the vortex's y=0 cut, so the outlet carries a prescribed Γ jump **no cut supports**. This is B3's recorded coplanarity rule, now in 3D. Outlet M **0.958** vs neumann **0.513**.
  - **(b) span-uniformity** — re-aiming the sheet coplanar (direction (1,0,0)) *shrinks but does not remove* it (outlet M **0.825**): one scalar Γ cannot match Γ(z)→0, and outboard of the tip there is no cut at all. This is exactly P5's branch-ray artifact, whose conforming fix was the Γ(z) taper.
  ⇒ **neumann carries no vortex, so neither defect can exist** — the taper is unnecessary on the B path rather than merely unimplemented. Cost: B5's O(Γ/R) outlet truncation (a few % of lift on a compact domain), which is why the bands are A/B bands, not <1% bands.

**★ Finding 3 — Γ(z) comes out spanwise-SMOOTH with no smoothing applied** (unplanned; it became visible the moment the real P5 curve was overlaid — `gamma_of_z.png`). Normalised RMS second difference of Γ(z): **0.0079 (M1) / 0.0091 (M4) vs 0.0970 for the conforming P5 — an 11–12× reduction.** The conforming path runs a **separate secant per TE station**, so its Γ(z) carries station-to-station jitter (this is the very defect P5's `INVESTIGATION_gamma_smoothing.md` chased, concluding that spanwise-Γ *smoothing* moves Γ **away** from the self-consistent value, and it is the same machinery whose single-station failure — st133, 32% under-circulated — cost P5 an entire investigation). The implicit Kutta has **no per-station loop to be noisy in**: Γ is one solution mode of the coupled system. So Track B does not merely *fix* the P5 spanwise-Γ problem — it makes the problem **structurally impossible**.

**★ Finding 4 — the 3D-only machinery works, and is cheap.** Γ(z) decays monotonically root→tip and reaches **~3e-4 at the tip** on both families — the spanwise clip delivers Γ(tip)=0 *discretely*, the level-set analogue of the conforming free-edge rule. The swept TE-polyline oblique frame and the g₂ spanwise-free jump gradient (structurally untestable on quasi-2D meshes) needed **no new code** — B1's fixes held. Cost was far below the plan's risk estimate: the per-outer `spsolve` on ~12k 3D DOFs is ~0.6 s, so a full 7-level continuation is **~20 min**, not hours.

**Honest caveats (recorded, not chased):**
1. **Convergence semantics = the recorded transonic Picard tail, not `tol_residual`.** The top Mach levels exhaust the 600-outer budget and park at |R| ~ 4–6e-6 (M1: levels 0.72–0.84; M4: 0.68/0.76/0.84). The field is **bounded and physical at every level** (0 limited / 0 floored throughout) and every gate metric is in band, so the gate is asserted on *bounded + in-band*, not on `converged` — the same P4/B6 engineering-converged regime. The cure is the LS Newton.
2. **LS Newton on M6 = DEFERRED.** `solve/newton_ls.py` uses a plain `splu`, and P8/N6 measured true-3D LU fill at ~100× the 2.5D cost (it needed lagged-LU). Porting `direct_refactor_every` to `newton_ls` is the follow-up; B6 already demonstrated the fold capability in 2D.
3. **Shock positions sit ~0.02–0.04 c aft of P5** (in band vs P5's ±0.06, and consistent with the higher circulation). Against the P8 *Newton* shocks the η=0.90 station is 0.087 aft — recorded; a shock-position A/B against Newton needs the deferred LS Newton to be a like-for-like comparison.
4. **Coarse only** (medium/fine M6 deferred: cost + fold risk).

### B8 — Level-set tip-edge desingularization ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-14 as CHARACTERIZED-NOT-CURED (user-arbitrated; row-blend 2026-07-13 + re-spec round 2026-07-14 both NEGATIVE with mechanisms pinned; B9 unblocked)
**Motivation:** P13/G13.2 fixed the tip/wake-edge singularity on the **conforming**
path with a spanwise loading taper `Γ_eff(z) = F(z)·Γ_Kutta(z)`
(`constraints/wake.py::tip_taper_factors`, applied on the per-station Kutta
target). That mechanism **cannot be ported literally** to the level-set path:
the LS path has **no Γ DOF** (Γ is a solution mode of the implicit Kutta) and its
TE Kutta row is the **homogeneous** pressure-equality condition
`s·(q_u−q_l) = 0` (`kernels/cut_assembly.py::te_kutta_coo`, RHS ≡ 0), so scaling
that row by F is an algebraic **no-op** (G13.2 finding (8)). The clean analogue —
also finding (8) — is a **convex BLEND** of the pressure-equality row with B2's
continuity weld `continuity_closure_coo` (Ŵ: `aux_k − main_j = 0`), per TE node:

    F_i · [ s·(q_u − q_l) ]  +  (1 − F_i) · [ φ_aux(i) − φ_main(i) ]  = 0

F=1 inboard ⇒ full pressure Kutta (bit-identical to today); F=0 at the tip ⇒
weld ⇒ jump `[φ]=0` at that node ⇒ the tip is unloaded — the structural analogue
of `Γ_eff→0`. The blend is **not** a no-op because the weld row is not
proportional to the pressure row (q_u, q_l come from different element sets, so
`q_u−q_l` is not a jump gradient). **This is a different MODEL from
`Γ=F·Γ_Kutta`** (finding (8)): r_c is calibrated independently and the two-path
comparison is a **physics A/B**, not a model-identity check. F(z) reuses the same
`tip_taper_factors`, fed the per-TE-node spanwise arclength `cm.q[cm.te_nodes]`
with `z_tip = cm.span_length`.
**Deliverable:** `tip_taper` (per-TE-node F array, default None ⇒ ones ⇒
bit-identical) threaded through `MultivaluedOperator.assemble_matrix` (blend in
the `closure="wake_ls"`, `te_kutta="pressure"` branch), the Picard drivers
(`solve_multivalued_lifting`/`_transonic`), and the LS Newton
(`solve_multivalued_newton`: blend residual + Jacobian on the TE aux rows).
Subsonic only — transonic M0.84 convergence stays with G13.3's round-ladder.
**Gates:**
- [x] `tip_taper=None` ⇒ B3/B4/B5/B6/B7 bit-identical; `F≡1` == current
  pressure-Kutta path (bitwise); `F≡0` ⇒ single-valued reduction (Γ≈0 / cl≈0).
  ✓ `tests/test_b8_tip_taper_ls.py` (13 passed); B-suite 59 passed / 0 failed.
- [x] blend-is-not-a-no-op unit test (contrast with the scaling no-op that
  motivates the model). ✓
- [ ] ❌ **mechanism probe — NOT MET, and the reason is the finding (below).**
  (★ user re-affirmed 2026-07-14: this unchecked line is KEPT BY DESIGN as the
  honest record of the characterized-not-cured closure — do not "fix" it.)
- [x] **two-path physics A/B** — ✓ RUN, and it is the decisive measurement:
  the taper bounds the CONFORMING edge and does NOT bound the level-set one.

**★★ RESULT 2026-07-13 — THE ROW BLEND DOES NOT CLOSE B8, BECAUSE ITS PREMISE IS
WRONG.** Demo `cases/demo/b8_tip_taper_ls/` (**12/12**, M6 coarse+medium, M∞0.5,
α3.06, `upwind_c=0` — no limiter, no shock; artifacts `b8_taper_ls.csv/.png`,
`checks_b8.csv`). The blend is **correctly implemented and behaves exactly as its
model predicts**: it converges cleanly (0 lim / 0 flr at every r_c), it
**UNLOADS the tip circulation far past the conforming criterion** (Γ_last ~ h^q
with **q = 4.73**, criterion q ≥ 1), and it is **perfectly LOCAL** (inboard Γ
**+0.01%**, cl_KJ **+0.03%**). **And yet the tip-edge peak STILL DIVERGES under
every taper**: p = **+1.341** untapered → **+1.37 / +1.41 / +1.58 / +1.37**
tapered (larger r_c is *worse*). Three findings:

1. **G13.2's DISCRETE mechanism does NOT transfer.** There, `p ≈ 1 − q` (the
   outermost TE station sheds Γ_last as a concentrated vortex over the last cell
   ⇒ edge ~ Γ_last/h ⇒ q ≥ 1 kills it). Here **q = 4.73 yet p = +1.37**, nowhere
   near 1 − q = −3.73. **Killing Γ_last does not kill the peak.**
2. **The lift cost is ~0 (+0.03%, vs the conforming taper's −1.74%) because there
   is NOTHING TO UNLOAD:** the level-set **implicit Kutta already drives
   Γ(tip) → 0 emergently** (B7 measured ±3e-4). The conforming path *needs* the
   taper because its free-edge rule leaves Γ_last ~ √h (q = 0.44). **The
   level-set path never had that disease.**
3. **★ MECHANISM — where the peak actually lives.** The peak cell is **OUTBOARD
   of the geometric tip** (z/b = **1.0118**, dx = +0.061), it is a
   **`beyond_tip` element** — one the **SPANWISE CLIP refuses to cut**
   (`cut_elements.py`: a crossing needs `q ≤ span_length`) — it is the **SAME
   element tapered or not** (elem 93977), and it is **NOT a small-cut sliver**
   (volume **0.71×** the median, and not even a cut element, so the CutFEM
   small-cut instability is ruled out). ⇒ **the level-set tip singularity lives
   in how the embedded sheet TERMINATES, not in the circulation it sheds.**
   (The untapered p = +1.341 reproduces G13.1's level-set exponent 1.34 exactly,
   so the metric is measuring the right object.)

⇒ **The two paths' tip singularities are DIFFERENT OBJECTS.** Finding (8)'s
"clean analogue" is a faithful analogue of the conforming *model*, but the
level-set path does not have the conforming path's disease — the analogue treats
a patient that is not ill. **The shipped machinery (`tip_taper` on the LS path)
is correct, tested and bit-identical by default; it is simply not the cure.**
**B8 needs a RE-SPEC aimed at the sheet TERMINATION** (the spanwise clip /
beyond-tip zone) — candidate directions: a graded/faded sheet termination, a
ghost-penalty-style stabilization of the clip boundary, or extending the sheet
past the tip. **User arbitration required before re-speccing.**

**Caveat recorded (cost boundary):** the LS path has **no `precond` option** —
`solve_multivalued_lifting` is hardcoded to sparse-direct `spsolve` (a deliberate
B2 decision; GMRES+AMG is the deferred B3+ scaling path). M6 **medium** costs
**~484 s / solve** at 67,426 extended dofs (~1.2 GB RSS). **M6 fine (~450k dofs)
on the LS path would hit the same splu wall P9 hit on the conforming Newton, with
no AMG escape hatch** ⇒ this demo is coarse+medium **by necessity**, and any
fine-mesh LS work needs the deferred GMRES+AMG path first.

**★★ RE-SPEC ROUND 2026-07-14 (user re-spec doc → diagnosis-first → span blend
RAN → NEGATIVE, mechanism pinned). Two findings supersede parts of the
2026-07-13 verdict above:**

1. **★ THE COMMITTED LS EXPONENT p = +1.34 WAS A ×5 METRIC ARTIFACT** (demo
   `run_b8_termination_diagnosis.py`, artifact `b8_termination_diagnosis.csv`;
   solves cached WITH `phi_ext` this time). `element_mach2` reads **mixed-side
   PLAIN elements** (exactly the beyond-tip class) from the aux-substituted
   SIDE field, but a plain element's **assembly is single-valued on MAIN dofs**
   (`mass_conservation_coo` scatters `el[plain]`) — the B6 `own_side_field`
   disease in the one element class own_side_field cannot fix (neither side
   field is the assembled one). At the verdict element (medium, elem 93977):
   **side 1.532 vs main 0.309**. The **HONEST untapered exponent is +0.620**
   (+0.367 with a V/median ≥ 0.1 sliver filter) — **the SAME OBJECT as the
   conforming +0.52, NOT a stronger one** ⇒ the 2026-07-13 "different objects"
   verdict holds for the *mechanism* (TE taper can't reach it) but its
   "LS 1.34 ≥ conforming 0.52" magnitude comparison is RETIRED, and **G13.1's
   LS-vs-conforming exponent comparison needs the same erratum** (its
   conforming numbers are metric-clean and stand). Fix shipped **opt-in**:
   `element_mach2(mixed_plain="main")` — default `"side"` keeps every
   committed diagnostic (B6/B7 M_max locks) bit-identical; **flipping the
   default + re-reading the B6/B7 M_max gate numbers is a recorded user
   arbitration item.** Related recorded (not fixed): the same aux-mixed side
   field feeds `element_densities`, so junk density weights DO enter the
   matrix on mixed-side plain elements (measured rho_up min 0.43 vs physical
   ~0.87 at M0.5 medium; no NaN) — a second arbitration item, since fixing it
   moves every committed LS gate number.
2. **The honest residual singularity is the sheet TERMINATION carrying a
   FINITE jump:** the last cut ring holds |δ| ≈ **0.026** (M6, h- AND
   TE-taper-INDEPENDENT — Γ_last→0 under the TE blend while the ring jump
   does not move; the two are **decoupled**, which is *why* the TE row blend
   measured no effect), dropped to zero across one single-valued element.
   Also recorded en route: the **untapered** emergent Γ(tip)→0 property
   degrades under refinement (Γ_last 0.00011 coarse → 0.00218 medium — B7's
   ±3e-4 was coarse-only).

**★★ THE SPAN BLEND (wake-LS-row termination softening) RAN → NEGATIVE ON
LOCALITY, mechanism pinned** (demo `run_b8_span_blend.py` **8/8**, artifacts
`b8_span_blend.csv/.png`, `checks_b8_span_blend.csv`; machinery
`MultivaluedOperator(span_blend=(form, r_blend))` — per non-TE cut node j,
`w_j·[wake-LS row] + (1−w_j)·s_j·[φ_aux−φ_main] = 0`, w_j from the same
`tip_taper_factors`, s_j = the row's own LS magnitude for h-invariance,
beyond-tip straddler nodes get w=0 at any r_blend; default None bit-identical,
`tests/test_b8_span_blend.py` 11 passed, B-suite 116 passed / 9 skipped).
The blend **hits its target** — the termination-ring jump is WELDED (0.026 →
0.001/0.0003 at r_blend 0.05/0.08 b) — **and the price disqualifies the
model**: (a) **~20% GLOBAL lift loss** (−19.8/−20.2/−21.8% at r_blend
0.03/0.05/0.08 medium), **UNIFORM in z** — Γ(z) scales down root-to-tip
including where the blended rows are bitwise identical to baseline — and
essentially **r_blend-INSENSITIVE** (2-point spread); (b) **component
isolation** (coarse): the straddler weld ALONE costs −13.3%, the inboard
smooth blend ALONE −10.8% ⇒ not a defect of either piece: **the implicit
Kutta has no per-station target — Γ is ONE global solution mode, and ANY
δ-pin on the sheet near the tip re-levels it** (G13.2 finding-(2)'s
fixed-point amplification acting GLOBALLY; the conforming secant keeps it
per-station, which is why the same F(z) costs −1.6% there and −20% here);
(c) the loss **GROWS under refinement** (rb0.08: −16.9% → −21.8%), so it
**CONTAMINATES the exponent**: p_unload ≈ −0.10 of the apparent
+0.37 → +0.05 reduction (corrected ~+0.15 — suggestive, NOT certifiable
under a 20% flow distortion, and moot at this cost); (d) a **narrow blend
(~2 elements, rb0.03) is ACTIVELY harmful** (ring jump ×2.26, honest
p +1.31). ⇒ **every constraint-side route is now measured: TE rows (no
effect), wake-LS rows (globally amplified damage). If a cure is still
wanted, it must change the FUNCTION SPACE at the termination** (how the
spanwise clip ends the multivalued region — e.g. sub-element termination of
the aux-DOF set), not add sheet-side constraints.

**★ ARBITRATED 2026-07-14 (user): B8 CLOSED as CHARACTERIZED-NOT-CURED.**
The honest LS tip exponent (+0.62 / +0.37 no-sliver) is the same object at
the same magnitude as the conforming +0.52 that every closed conforming gate
lives with ⇒ **B9 (wing-body LS solve, M∞0.5) is UNBLOCKED**. Recorded
BACKLOG (not scheduled): (a) flip the `element_mach2` default to
`mixed_plain="main"` + re-read the B6/B7 M_max locks + the G13.1 LS-exponent
erratum; (b) fix the `element_densities` mixed-plain junk weights (moves
every committed LS gate number — needs its own A/B). The function-space
termination re-spec stays a candidate only if a future gate actually needs
the LS tip edge bounded. All shipped machinery (`span_blend`, `mixed_plain`)
is default-inert and stays. Evidence: demo_report "Track B / B8 re-spec"
section.

headline stands**). GB9.1 (conforming Newton converges coarse+medium, probe 2/5 +
pressure 3/4 steps, 0 lim/flr) ✓, GB9.2 (LS Picard converges both) ✓, GB9.3
(junction TE-CV wing-side, `tests/test_b9_wingbody_{conforming,ls}.py`) ✓.
- ★ **GB9.4 XFAIL (documented-open, like G1.6): the "fuselage carries no lift"
  premise is FALSE as measured.** Fuselage pressure-lift is 16% (conf) / 20%
  (LS) of the wing's at medium, and the LS value GROWS with refinement
  (0.164 → 0.205) while conforming stays flat — the signature of the G1.6
  smooth-wall flat-facet natural-BC error on the fuselage (GB9.6's subject),
  NOT clean physics. Band NOT moved after the fact (house rule); recorded as
  the open state a wing-body body-surface claim carries until P11/Option C.
- ★ **LS uses PICARD, not Newton — measured, not assumed (user-questioned).**
  The committed LS Newton recipes (lagged-LU, `precond="schur"` B14, N5 freeze,
  the B15 Mach ramp) ALL diverge/churn on the subsonic wing-body. Diagnostic at
  the converged Picard state: the wake/Kutta rows are PERFECT
  (max|R[te_aux]| = 1.8e-8) but 8 far-field FLUID rows carry |R| ≈ 84 — a
  localized inconsistency in the **`farfield="freestream"` Newton path**, which
  was never exercised (every committed LS Newton run uses `neumann`, and the
  fuselage BLOCKAGE makes `neumann` unbounded, res → 1e43). So the failure is
  the far-field BC layer, orthogonal to the linear solver (Schur/spsolve) and
  the wake model. LS Picard with `freestream` converges cleanly (res 3e-7).
  A `newton_ls.py` freestream bug (Dirichlet values left None) was fixed in
  passing; the residual inconsistency at the outer boundary is a recorded
  follow-up (subsonic LS Newton for a blunt body), not a B9 blocker.
- ★ **Conforming wing-body — the NEW capability.**
  `onera_m6_wingbody_mesh(embed_wake=True)`: the fuselage is built as TWO
  π-revolves (`add_fuselage_solid_split`) so the y=0 meridians are genuine seam
  edges — a single periodic revolve surface with the waterline imprinted to the
  degenerate tail pole is UNMESHABLE (every 2D algorithm fails "1D mesh not
  forming a closed loop"). The sheet passes through the body, fragment-trims to
  exposed TE + waterline + aft symmetry + tip/downstream, and embeds; Netgen is
  OFF for embed (segfaults). `cut_wake` / constraints / P14 pressure-Kutta ALL
  unchanged; the waterline duplicates via the existing boundary-edge rule.
  `embed_wake=False` bit-identical (n_tets 65621 exact). Generation-time
  `cut_wake` ingest gate = the crack detector (all free nodes at the tip).
  Coarse 90099 tets, medium 679391.
- **GB9.6 RECORDED** (`cases/analysis/b9_fuselage_guardrail/`): isolated
  body-of-revolution h-sweep α=0, azimuthal Cp scatter (reference-free) median
  DECAYS 0.0036/0.0022/0.0010 (coarse/medium/fine h_body) but max GROWS
  0.042/0.096/0.117 (nose/tail poles) — the G1.6 error class, quantified.

**Deliverable (re-spec'd):** run BOTH wake models with Newton on the M2
wing-body geometry (coarse + medium, M∞ 0.5, α 3.06° — the committed M6
subsonic convention), each with its best-known recipe, and compare spanwise
lift Γ(z)/cl(z), section Cp, convergence histories, and the A1 timing
breakdown. The conforming leg is a NEW capability (no conforming wing-body
mesh/generator existed; `cut_wake` ValueErrors on the wake-free family) —
the design routes it through a wake-embedded variant of the M2 family
(`onera_m6_wingbody_conforming/`), with the sheet fragment-trimmed to the
fuselage waterline and extended to the symmetry plane aft of the body
(simple-connectivity) and to the far-field sphere (branch-cut Dirichlet
data), reusing the existing `cut_wake` boundary-edge duplication rule
unchanged (the waterline duplicates by the same mechanism as the wing-alone
symmetry root edge).

**Original gates (pre-2026-07-17), kept for the audit trail:**
- ~~two-element cl's plausible~~ — SUPERSEDED (multi-element moved out of B9,
  not scheduled anywhere)
- fuselage carries no lift → now GB9.4
- ★ fuselage surface-Cp guardrail (user-arbitrated 2026-07-14: isolated
  body-of-revolution subsonic h-sweep, error magnitude RECORDED, no pass/fail
  line; caveat carried by every wing-body surface-pressure claim until
  P11/Option C) → now GB9.6, kept verbatim in intent (user re-confirmed
  2026-07-17)

**Gates (pre-registered 2026-07-17, BEFORE any wing-body solve was run):**
- [x] **GB9.1** ✓ conforming wing-body capability: wake-embedded mesh variant
      passes the family quality gates + a generation-time `cut_wake` ingest
      gate (all free nodes at the tip z≈B_SEMI — the crack detector; innermost
      station z≈0.15; waterline wake∩fuselage nodes all duplicated); M0.5
      probe Newton → probe-seeded pressure Newton (P14 recipe) both converge
      on coarse AND medium with 0 limited / 0 floored. **✓ probe 2/5 +
      pressure 4/3 steps, 0/0; meshes 90099 / 679391 tets.**
- [x] **GB9.2** ✓ LS wing-body capability: converges on coarse AND medium;
      TE-node census = the M2 locks (76 coarse / 150 medium) at α 3.06°
      (TE identification is aim-independent; the cut-element census is NOT —
      recorded, not locked). **★ RE-SPEC of the SOLVER within this gate: the
      committed LS Newton recipes (lagged-LU, Schur, N5 freeze, Mach ramp) all
      diverge/churn on the subsonic wing-body — the failure is the
      `neumann` far field (fuselage blockage → unbounded), not the solver; LS
      uses its proven subsonic solver PICARD with `farfield="freestream"` (res
      3e-7). See the RESULT block above.**
- [x] **GB9.3** ✓ junction TE-CV verification (the M2 open item, BOTH paths):
      the junction station's upper/lower Kutta control volumes contain only
      wing-side elements — LS: audit `multivalued.py::_build_te_control_volumes`
      fans against the wing/fuselage face sets (wing-only `wall_nodes` is the
      wiring); conforming: `te_pressure.py::TEControlVolumes` builds adjacency
      from `boundary_faces["wall"]` only — assert construction + nonempty
      junction fans + finite implied targets. **✓ both paths, coarse+medium
      (`tests/test_b9_wingbody_{ls,conforming}.py`).**
- [~] **GB9.4** ✗ XFAIL (documented-open): fuselage carries no lift
      |cl_fus(pressure)| ≤ 0.05 · cl_p(wing) at medium. **MEASURED 16% (conf) /
      20% (LS), LS GROWS with refinement 0.164→0.205 ⇒ the G1.6 fuselage-Cp
      discretization error (GB9.6), not clean physics. Band NOT moved (house
      rule); the caveat a wing-body body-surface claim carries until
      P11/Option C.** Structural half census-locked (zero TE stations inboard
      of the junction).
- [x] **GB9.5** ✓ cross-model agreement at medium M0.5: conforming-pressure vs
      LS agree to **< 1%** on cl_p(wing) AND on cl_KJ under the SAME
      exposed-span reducer (trapezoid over actual stations + tip closure, NO
      root flat-extension; the conforming flat carry-through value recorded
      as a supplementary column). Band justification: the wing-alone
      cross-model precedent is 0.17%/0.36% at M0.84 with shocks and different
      mesh families; wing-body is same-geometry subsonic but the junction
      discretization is new — 1% = the G14.7 house band. Coarse RECORDED.
      Same-extractor discipline throughout (A2/V14.6): section Cp via
      `section_cp_curve`/`section_cp_curve_levelset` (both walk `wall` only),
      LS TE gap re-measured through the same all-station sweep, never the
      mvop's own CVs. **✓ MEDIUM cl_p 0.4% / cl_kj 0.6% (conf 0.2173/0.2188 vs
      LS 0.2165/0.2175); coarse 12.8%/8.7% RECORDED (~~pure resolution~~ — B17
      erratum: largely far-field CONTAMINATION; pin_gamma lifts coarse LS to
      0.2087 ≡ conforming).**
- [x] **GB9.6** ✓ RECORDED fuselage surface-Cp guardrail (carried from the
      2026-07-14 arbitration): isolated body-of-revolution h-sweep
      (h_body 0.060/0.030/0.015 = the wing-body coarse/medium/fine skin
      resolutions), α=0 non-lifting; primary metric = azimuthal Cp scatter
      per x-bin (reference-free absolute discretization error at α=0),
      secondary = self-convergence deltas (stated as SELF-convergence, with
      the G1.6 sphere calibration quoted — this error class partially hides
      from Richardson). No pass/fail line; the caveat stands until
      P11/Option C. **✓ azimuthal scatter median DECAYS 0.0036/0.0022/0.0010,
      max GROWS 0.042/0.096/0.117 (nose/tail poles) — the G1.6 class.**
- Convergence histories + timing breakdowns: RECORDED-not-gated (no committed
  wing-body anchors exist; these runs become the first).

**Scope guards (carried + updated):** subsonic M∞ 0.5 ONLY (M0.84 excluded —
G13.3 transonic NEGATIVE stands); meshes = the M2 family and its new
conforming variant, coarse + medium only, both gitignored (regenerate before
running); `wall_tag` stays `"wall"` on both paths (widening it to include
`fuselage` would mint spurious Kutta stations along the waterline);
conforming recipe = `M6_NEWTON_KW` (farfield_spanwise_gamma=True,
precond="direct", direct_refactor_every=1000) with the P14 probe-seeded
pressure Newton; LS recipe = lagged-LU primary (A1 anchor lineage) +
`precond="schur"` as a secondary timing row at medium (B14: 2.08× at M6
medium M0.5), γ agreement |Δγ| ≲ 1e-8 per the GB14.4 precedent.

### B10 — Curved wake / free wake ⊘ (was B9 2026-07-13; orig B7→B6; SHELVED 2026-07-10)
**Deliverable:** Curved wake / free wake — **SHELVED 2026-07-10** (DN2 §4.5.6: loading error of a straight wake is O(θ²) ≈ 0.1%; per-update CutElementMap/DOF rebuild cost; discrete cut-set jumps conflict with Newton; López precedent). `update_direction()` interface capability retained.
**Gate:** — (shelved; no gate)

### B11 — LS-path infrastructure: unified post-processing + GMRES/AMG scaling ✓ (NEW 2026-07-14, user-directed; appended after B10, no renumber; CLOSED 2026-07-14)
**Deliverable:** two long-standing LS-path infrastructure gaps closed together
(a B9 enabler — the wing-body medium LS solve would otherwise hit the same
splu wall).

**(1) Unified post-processing.** `post/surface.py` (conforming) and
`post/surface_ls.py` (level-set) now share private cores — `surface._cp_from_q2`
(the per-triangle isentropic/Bernoulli Cp branch), `surface._pressure_force`
(the `-(cp·area)·n_out/s_ref` integral + lift/drag projection),
`section_cut._wall_plane_crossings` + `_resolve_station` + `_section_curve_dict`
(the triangle plane-cut loop + station resolve + chord/x_le normalize),
`surface_ls._d11_wall_state` (the D11 two-sided q² selection, formerly
duplicated twice inside surface_ls). The three near-duplicate blocks
(Cp+D11, the copy-pasted section-cut loop, the force integral) collapse to
one implementation each. New upper layer `post/unified.py` dispatches by
keyword — `wall_cp` / `wall_forces` / `section_cp`, taking `phi=` (conforming)
or `mvop=,phi_ext=` (level-set) — so one call site serves both paths; outputs
are `np.array_equal` to the legacy functions by construction. **Every legacy
public function keeps its name/signature** (14+ demos, 10+ test files), and the
extraction preserved float op order, so the bit-identity locks
(`test_b7_onera_m6.py::test_d11_upper_surface_equals_the_main_based_section`,
the shock `x_shock` asserts, `test_post_surface.py`) pass unchanged. Bonus:
`section_cp_curve_levelset` / `wall_cp_levelset` gain the opt-in `smooth_passes`
(the conforming G6.1 gradient smoothing), default 0 = bit-identical.

**(2) GMRES+AMG on the LS solvers (the deferred design_track_b.md §5.3
landing).** `solve_multivalued_laplace` / `_lifting` / `_newton` grow
`precond=None|"ilu"|"amg"` (None = the pre-B11 sparse-direct `spsolve`,
bit-identical default) plus `linear_rtol=1e-10`, `gmres_restart`,
`gmres_maxiter`, `amg_rebuild_every`; `solve_multivalued_transonic` inherits
them through `**kwargs` (zero code); `newton_ls` adds `seed_precond`. "ilu"/"amg"
run `solve/linear.solve_gmres` on the fused nonsymmetric matrix (the escape from
the M6-fine splu wall). **★ ILU is the effective escape** (`precond="ilu"`,
spilu on the real fused A_free): converges at 434 iters coarse, |Δγ| < 1e-8,
warm-started per outer. **★ AMG does NOT converge on the lifting operator
(measured, honest result).** `_amg_surrogate_preconditioner` builds SA-AMG on an
SPD surrogate (the single-valued Picard block + SPD springs tying each aux dof
to its coincident host so SA aggregates them, §5.3 "把 N_ext 个辅助 DOF 当普通节点
处理") — this works for the `continuity`-closure (Laplace/B2) system, but on the
`wake_ls`-closure lifting/transonic/Newton operator the aux rows are the g₁+g₂
wake-LS + nonlinear TE-Kutta rows (convection-like, not SPD springs), the
surrogate cannot model them, and **GMRES stalls at the restart cap** (coarse
M0.5 lifting: γ 0.0033 vs 0.139, all 80 outers stalled, 455 s vs ILU's 2.7 s).
So AMG stays wired for the SPD Laplace case + as the recorded §5.3 knob, and
**ILU is the shipped lifting escape**. The **Núñez symmetric row assignment
(§5.3 fallback) stays not-prebuilt** — the route that would restore genuine AMG
applicability if ILU's fill ever becomes the bottleneck at fine scale.
**lagged-LU (`direct_refactor_every`) is OUT of B11 scope** (recorded roadmap
follow-up below): B11 ships the iterative escape, not the direct-reuse one.

**Gates:**
- [x] **G11.1 bit-identity:** full suite green with zero committed-number changes
      (D11 array-equal lock + every shock lock pass untouched); the refactor
      adds only the 9 `test_b11_post_unified.py` tests; `precond` default None
      pinned by `test_b11_linear_ls.py::test_precond_default_is_none`.
- [x] **G11.2 unified == legacy:** `np.array_equal` on cp/q2/section outputs,
      exact-float on cl, both paths (`test_b11_post_unified.py` + demo
      `run_b11_unified_post.py` self-check column max|Δcp| = 0.0).
- [x] **G11.3 GMRES correctness:** ILU reproduces spsolve on the coarse
      (+ demo medium) 2.5D meshes — Laplace/lifting/Newton |Δγ| < 1e-8 subsonic,
      converged, 0 stalls (`test_b11_linear_ls.py`; gated transonic-forwarding
      smoke |Δγ| < 1e-6). AMG reproduces spsolve on the SPD Laplace only;
      measured to STALL on the wake_ls lifting operator (455 s, non-converged)
      ⇒ ILU is the shipped lifting escape (an honest §5.3 finding).
- [x] **G11.4 scaling headline — the splu wall quantified:** M6 medium LS A/B
      CSV committed (`cases/demo/b11_ls_infra/results/m6_medium_ab.csv`, gated
      one-shot). **spsolve = 454.8 s at 67,426 dofs** (the splu wall; the P9
      catastrophe at 450 k fine). ★ **Honest finding:** the M6-medium 3D fused
      matrix resists cheap incomplete factorization — ILU-GMRES advances ~17 of
      26 outers, then even shifted-MILU at fill 20 goes singular at a hard
      outer; near-full fill (≈spsolve cost at this size) would be needed ⇒ **at
      67 k dofs spsolve is still the right tool, ILU is not advantageous there.**
      The escape's payoff is the FINE-scale regime where spsolve is impossible on
      memory (feasibility, extrapolated); the escape is *demonstrated to
      converge* at 2.5D medium (|Δγ| 7.5e-10, 0 stalls; `solver_ab.csv`).
      **Follow-ups:** the Núñez symmetric row assignment (§5.3 — would restore
      AMG and a cheaper factorization; still not scheduled) and the
      `direct_refactor_every` (lagged-LU) port into `newton_ls` (roadmap "LS
      Newton on M6 = DEFERRED") — the latter **executed as B12 (2026-07-14)**.

**Evidence:** tests `tests/test_b11_post_unified.py` (9) +
`tests/test_b11_linear_ls.py` (10 + 1 gated); demos
`cases/demo/b11_ls_infra/` (`run_b11_unified_post.py`, `run_b11_gmres_ls.py`,
`run_b11_m6_headline.py` [gated]). Conforming solver numerics byte-untouched;
no Numba kernel or COO-assembly path touched (pure SciPy/PyAMG + numpy).

### B12 — Lagged-LU direct-reuse for LS Newton (medium/M6-scale enabler) ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-14 (NEW, user-directed; appended after B11, no renumber; executes the B11/G11.4 recorded follow-up "LS Newton on M6 = DEFERRED")
**Deliverable:** make the level-set Newton solve affordable at medium/M6 sizes by
porting the conforming N6 **lagged-LU direct-reuse** mechanism into
`solve/newton_ls.py`.

**Why this and not the B11 iterative escapes.** B11 measured (G11.4 A/B,
`cases/demo/b11_ls_infra/results/`) that the iterative escapes fail on the fused
level-set matrix beyond coarse — so at medium/M6 sparse-direct is the only
converging tool, and the cost driver is then the **number of factorizations**:

| case | dofs | spsolve | ILU | AMG |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.5D coarse lifting | 6,614 | ✓ 1.9 s | ✓ (\|Δγ\| 9.5e-9) | STALL |
| 2.5D **medium** lifting | 22,880 | ✓ 8.6 s | ✗ **diverges** γ=−137, 77 stalls | STALL |
| **M6 medium** lifting | 67,426 | ✓ 454.8 s / 26 outer / **17.5 s per factor** | ✗ **factor_failed** | STALL |

LS Newton with `precond=None` factorizes on **every** Newton step, so on M6
medium it pays that 17.5 s once per iteration.

**Implementation (`solve/newton_ls.py`, the ONLY production change).** Two new
kwargs on `solve_multivalued_newton`: `direct_refactor_every: int = 1` and
`direct_reuse_rtol: float = 1e-8`, active only on the `precond is None` branch.
`k=1` (default) = the byte-identical per-step `spsolve`. `k>1` = refactor the LU
(`spla.splu`) every k-th step and drive the intermediate steps with GMRES on the
FRESH Jacobian preconditioned by the stale (exact) LU, converged to
`direct_reuse_rtol`; a reuse step whose GMRES fails falls back to a refactor +
exact solve in the same iteration (robustness never below every-step-direct).
This is the N6 mechanism (`solve/newton.py::direct_refactor_every`) **minus the
Woodbury** — the level-set system has NO Γ DOF, so the step is a plain
`J_free d = −R_free` with no low-rank coupling. New monitor `n_refactor`.

**Gates:**
- [x] **G12.1 bit-identity — CLOSED 2026-07-14.** `direct_refactor_every=1`
      (default) is byte-identical to the pre-B12 `spsolve` path (same `phi_ext`,
      `n_refactor==0`, `n_gmres_total==0`); the two params default to 1 / 1e-8.
      `tests/test_b12_lagged_lu_ls.py::test_lagged_lu_param_defaults` +
      `test_default_bit_identical_to_spsolve`. B6/B11 Newton locks unchanged.
- [x] **G12.2 numerical equivalence (core gate) — CLOSED 2026-07-14.** On the
      coarse 2.5D mesh at M0.70 (upwind active), `direct_refactor_every` 2 and
      1000 both reach the spsolve default's converged γ (0.1778053693) to
      **bit-identity** (|Δγ| < 1e-8), 0 lim/flr, 0 GMRES stalls, and actually
      reuse the stale LU: **k=1000 refactors ONCE** over 6 Newton iters (vs 5
      spsolve factorizations at k=1), k=2 refactors 3× — `n_refactor < n_newton`
      and a reuse GMRES step ran. `tests/test_b12_lagged_lu_ls.py::
      test_lagged_lu_matches_spsolve` (k∈{2,1000}).
- [x] **G12.3 scaling headline (gated) — CLOSED 2026-07-14.** M6-medium subsonic
      (M0.5, α3.06, `farfield="neumann"`, 67,426 dofs) LS Newton A/B from a shared
      Picard seed. Both take **7 Newton steps to a genuine converged solution**
      (0 lim/flr); spsolve refactors all 7 (**145.6 s**), lagged-LU (k=1000)
      refactors **ONCE** + 30 reuse-GMRES iters (**66.7 s = 2.18× faster on the
      Newton phase**), 0 stalls, **γ bit-identical** (0.06685284, |Δγ| = 6.74e-13).
      Demo `cases/demo/b12_lagged_lu/run_b12_m6_newton.py` (**6/6 PASS**),
      `results/m6_newton_ab.csv` + `checks_m6_newton.csv`.
      **★ Honest boundary:** at 67k dofs one splu fits in memory ⇒ this is a REAL
      runnable medium-scale win, not an extrapolation. But lagged-LU still needs
      ≥1 in-memory splu, so it does **not** break the FINE-mesh memory wall (P9's
      26 GB / 4h39m is per-factorization, not per-count) — that regime remains
      the Núñez symmetric-row-assignment → AMG route (design_track_b §5.3, not
      prebuilt).

**Out of scope (recorded):** the LS-Newton Mach-continuation *ramp* wrapper
(`newton_ls` is single-Mach-level; the conforming `solve_newton_transonic`
analogue is a separate follow-up), and genuine AMG applicability (Núñez rows).

**Evidence:** `tests/test_b12_lagged_lu_ls.py` (4); demo
`cases/demo/b12_lagged_lu/` (6/6, G12.3 headline CSV). `solve/newton_ls.py` is
the only production change; default path byte-identical. Suite +4.

### B13 — Lagged-LU on the Picard outer loop (the post-B12 cost driver) ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-14 (NEW, user-directed; appended after B12, no renumber)
**Deliverable:** the B12 lagged-LU mechanism applied to the Picard OUTER loop
(`solve_multivalued_lifting`; transonic inherits via `**kwargs`) — after B12
the M6-medium cost driver is one 17.5 s spsolve per Picard outer (B11 lifting
headline 454.8 s / 26 outers; the B12 demo's Newton seed 263 s / 15 outers).
User goal arbitrated 2026-07-14: **compute speed at medium scale is the
objective; fine-mesh extension is optional** — which ranks lagged-LU (this)
above the structural preconditioner (B14, designed-not-scheduled below).
`solve_multivalued_laplace` is excluded — it is a single-shot solve, nothing to
amortize.

**External-analysis corrections (recorded; GLM analysis + comparison doc,
baseline f9d400a, both predating B12):** (1) "lagged-LU port = not done" was
true at their baseline; B12 landed it for Newton the same day. (2) The Schur
direction in both docs is inverted — the efficient elimination removes the
SMALL aux block (`K = J_mm − J_ma·J_aa⁻¹·J_am`, J_aa an n_ext×n_ext thin-strip
matrix ~8k at M6 medium), not the main block (which would need A_mm⁻¹ = an AMG
inner solve per application). (3) J_aa is not fully constant — wake-LS rows are
(§5.5) but the TE-Kutta rows (76–150) re-linearize each outer; refactoring the
thin strip is milliseconds, a non-issue. (4) 454.8 s is 26 outers, not one
splu (17.5 s each).

**Gates (GB13.x — deliberately NOT G13.x, which is P13's namespace; Track V's
GV prefix is the precedent):**
- [x] **GB13.1 bit-identity — CLOSED 2026-07-14.** `direct_refactor_every=1`
      (default) is byte-identical to the per-outer `spsolve` (same `phi_ext`,
      `n_refactor==0`, `n_gmres_total==0`); defaults pinned.
      `tests/test_b13_lagged_picard.py`.
- [x] **GB13.2 equivalence (core) — CLOSED 2026-07-14.** Coarse 2.5D lifting
      M0.5: k∈{4,1000} reach the spsolve γ to <1e-8, converged, 0 stalls,
      `n_refactor < n_outer` (k=1000 refactors ONCE); also under
      `farfield="neumann"` (the B6/B7 recipe) at k=8.
      ★ **Measured finding: `direct_reuse_rtol` must default 1e-10, NOT B12's
      1e-8** — a Picard fixed point is pinned only by its lag tolerances
      (1e-6), so an inexact reuse step SHIFTS the stopping point (|Δγ| 8e-8 at
      rtol 1e-8), whereas Newton's terminus is pinned by `tol_residual`
      regardless; 1e-10 restores <1e-8 agreement for ~1–2 extra Krylov iters
      on a near-exact preconditioner.
- [x] **GB13.3 M6-medium headline (gated) — CLOSED 2026-07-14.** B11-headline
      lifting (M0.5, α3.06, neumann, tol 1e-7, 67,426 dofs, 26 outers both):
      spsolve **447.6 s** (17.2 s/outer) vs lagged-LU (k=1000) **68.3 s**
      (2.63 s/outer) = **6.55× faster**, 2 refactors vs 26, γ bit-identical
      (0.06685270, |Δγ| 6.9e-13). The 1 GMRES "stall" is the designed safety
      net — an early outer's large density move exhausts the stale LU and
      triggers an extra refactor (hence 2, not 1), never a divergence.
      **End-to-end seed+Newton** (the B12 pipeline, both mechanisms on): seed
      **42 s** (1 refactor / 15 outers, was 263 s spsolve) + Newton **69.9 s**
      = **111.9 s total vs ~330 s post-B12 baseline (~3×)**, Newton γ 0.06685284
      in the B12 lock band. Demo `cases/demo/b13_lagged_picard/` (**6/6 PASS**),
      `m6_lifting_ab.csv` + `m6_end_to_end.csv`.
      **★ Honest boundary:** amortizes the factorization COUNT; still needs
      ≥1 in-memory splu ⇒ does NOT break the fine-mesh memory wall (that is
      B14's unique value).

**Result headline:** M6-medium lifting **447.6 s → 68.3 s (6.55×)**; end-to-end
seed+Newton **~330 s → 111.9 s (~3×)** — the LS medium workflow is now the same
order as conforming M6 medium (solve 140–240 s). **Evidence:**
`tests/test_b13_lagged_picard.py` (5); demo `cases/demo/b13_lagged_picard/`

path byte-identical. Suite +5.

**★ Workflow evidence riding on B12/B13 (2026-07-15, demo — not a gate):
`cases/demo/m6_medium_ls_workflow/` (10/10 self-checks; full record in
demo_report "M6 medium level-set WORKFLOW").** M6 medium wake-free LS solves
BOTH subsonic M0.5 (cl 0.212, strict-converged) and transonic M0.84 (cl 0.276,
M_max 2.455, bounded/engineering-converged, B7 semantics) at
conforming-comparable cost. Mesh A/B (wake-free vs embedded) cl within
0.62%/0.85%; method A/B (LS vs conforming) 0.47% subsonic / +10.65% transonic
(the B6/B7 conforming-Picard under-circulation, not an LS error). Load-bearing
recipe finding: the M6-medium transonic **Picard residual plateaus at
1e-5..1e-4** (P4/B6/N5 shock-position soft mode) — use `tol_residual=1e-5` or
every level burns its full budget (~1 h); a strict-converged transonic wants
the LS Newton ramp instead — which **B15 then delivered** (GB15.4 removes this
plateau, 3.5×).

### B14 — Schur-eliminated aux block + AMG(SPD Picard main block) ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-17 (opened + built same day, user-directed)

**Built.** `precond="schur"` on both LS drivers, in `pyfp3d/solve/schur_ls.py`
(`SchurReducedSystem` + `main_block_preconditioner` + `jaa_diagnostic`), shared
by `solve_multivalued_newton` and `solve_multivalued_lifting` (transonic
wrappers inherit via `**kwargs`). Per Newton step / Picard outer: factor the
aux thin-strip `lu_aa = splu(J_aa)` (n_ext-sized — 1004/3701 dofs at M6
coarse/medium, split+factor ≤ 19 ms), run GMRES on the matrix-free reduced
operator `K = J_mm − J_ma·J_aa⁻¹·J_am` preconditioned by AMG on the SPD
single-valued Picard block restricted to main-free (the conforming
`solve/newton.py` analogue), back-substitute the aux part exactly. The AMG
hierarchy is invalidated at the three freeze selection-epoch sites alongside
`lu_direct`. A stalled reduced GMRES falls back to a full fused spsolve in the
same step (`n_schur_fallback`, the lagged-LU safety-net pattern) — never
triggered in the whole campaign.

**Gates.**
- [x] **GB14.1** diagnostic-first — J_aa factors on every measured case; 1-norm
  cond estimate finite (2.5D coarse 5.1e8 / 2.5D medium 8.2e9 / M6 coarse 6.5e6
  / M6 medium 7.4e7). Measured, not assumed — the constant-jump null vector
  mixes main+aux columns and the TE-Kutta rows pin the level, so J_aa is
  generically nonsingular, and it is.
- [x] **GB14.2** correctness — 2.5D coarse lifting + Newton M0.7 land on the
  spsolve γ (\|Δγ\| 4.2e-11 / 2.0e-12), 0 stalls / 0 fallbacks. This is the
  exact operator where the B11 spring surrogate stalled to γ 0.0033 (vs 0.139):
  no springs, no bias, the circulation mode survives.
- [x] **GB14.3** the discriminating tier — 2.5D **MEDIUM** lifting, where ILU
  DIVERGED (γ = −136.99, 77 stalls, `b11_ls_infra/solver_ab.csv`): schur
  converges to γ 0.14137632, \|Δγ\| 9.3e-10, 0 stalls/fallbacks. "Passing there
  is what a real escape means."
- [x] **GB14.4** 3-D capability — ONERA M6 wake-free COARSE + MEDIUM, subsonic
  M0.5 lifting AND transonic M0.84 Newton ramp, all converge / target-reached;
  γ matches the same-session lagged-LU arm to \|Δγ\| ≤ 1.5e-8 and the committed
  GB15.4 state exactly (γ **0.088338**, M_max **2.4938**).
- [x] **GB14.5** inertness — default `precond=None` byte-identical
  (`np.array_equal` on `phi_ext`), `n_schur_fallback`/`n_gmres_total` inert at 0.

**★ Timing (RECORDED, not a gate — the design pre-declared the medium-scale
gain "uncertain"; it landed on the winning side).** M6 medium fresh
same-session A/B (identical lagged-LU seeds):

| M6 medium (63,100 dofs) | lagged-LU | schur | speedup | precond share |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| M0.5 subsonic lifting | 73.2 s | **35.2 s** | **2.08×** | 51.7% → **5.2%** |
| M0.84 transonic ramp | 671.2 s | **469.3 s** | **1.43×** | 43.6% → **2.6%** |

The A1 bottleneck (LS Newton M6 medium M0.84 = 42.6% precond, A1's own
measurement; the same-session B14 A/B reads 43.6%) is structurally
gone: the full-size `splu` factorizations lagged-LU still needed (2 per solve,
17.5 s each) are replaced by a thin-strip LU + AMG V-cycles. That beats the
user's stated <10% target on both regimes. γ is bit-close to the committed
GB15.4 (\|Δγ\| 2e-13 on the ramp).

**★ Honest limit — where schur is SLOWER.** At small scale it LOSES: 2.5D
coarse/medium and M6 coarse are 3–6× slower with schur (the direct solve there
is already trivially cheap — the reduced-GMRES iteration count costs more than
the tiny factorization). The win appears only at M6-medium size and grows with
the mesh, exactly as the design predicted ("marginal at medium, the unique
value is the FINE memory-bounded path"). The **fine-scale route (AMG O(n) +
thin-strip LU, no full-size splu that cannot fit in memory) remains the
designed, unbuilt use-case** — out of scope here by user direction
(coarse+medium only). Fallbacks (block-triangular; Núñez additive row
assignment) were NOT needed — the aux block factored and GMRES converged on
every case.

Evidence: `tests/test_b14_schur_ls.py` (9, incl. the gated GB14.3 medium
escape); demo `cases/demo/b14_schur_precond/` (**7/7 self-checks, incl. gated
M6 coarse+medium A/B**; the M6-medium states cache to gitignored
`results/*.npz`, committed evidence = the 5 PNGs + `schur_ab.csv` +
`jaa_diag.csv` + `checks.csv`).

<details><summary>Original design snapshot (2026-07-14, now built)</summary>

**Why not now (user-arbitrated 2026-07-14):** at medium scale its marginal gain
over B13 is uncertain (lagged-LU already amortizes to ~1–3 factorizations per
solve ≈ 35 s; Schur+AMG trades that for per-outer GMRES+AMG cost of the same
order), and its unique value — the FINE-scale memory-bounded path (AMG O(n) +
thin-strip LU, no full-size splu) — addresses a regime the user has declared
optional. **Trigger:** GB13.3 lands and medium is still too slow, or a real
M6/wing-body FINE campaign is scheduled.

**Design snapshot (ready to build):** new `precond="schur"` on the LS drivers.
Free dofs split main-free/aux (aux are never Dirichlet — the B3 load-bearing
fact). Per outer/Newton step: `lu_aa = splu(J_aa)` (n_ext×n_ext thin strip,
~8k at M6 medium, milliseconds; TE-Kutta rows re-linearize per step, so
refactor per step). Reduced operator matrix-free:
`K x = J_mm x − J_ma·lu_aa.solve(J_am x)`; reduced RHS
`r = b_m − J_ma·lu_aa.solve(b_a)`; back-substitution
`φ_a = lu_aa.solve(b_a − J_am φ_m)`. Preconditioner =
`build_amg_preconditioner(op.assemble_matrix(rho_own))` restricted to
main-free — the exact conforming analogue (AMG on the SPD Picard block,
constraints eliminated exactly), **with NO springs**: the B11 surrogate's
mismatch (springs bias the solution toward jump≈0, killing the global
circulation mode — γ 0.0033 vs 0.139) disappears structurally because no aux
dof survives into the preconditioned system. GMRES then faces "elliptic +
cut-strip-localized correction" — the operator shape the conforming path
already proved AMG-preconditionable. **Diagnostic-first gate:** J_aa
invertibility/conditioning (the constant-jump null vector mixes main+aux
columns ⇒ J_aa generically nonsingular, TE-Kutta pins the level — measure,
don't assume); the discriminating tier is **2.5D medium lifting, where ILU
DIVERGED (γ=−137)** — passing there is what "a real escape" means. Fallbacks:
block-triangular preconditioner; last resort = the Núñez additive symmetric
row assignment (§5.3 — a discretization change with penalty-weight
calibration, demoted to third line).

### B15 — LS Newton transonic ramp + N5 freeze-selection ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-15 (NEW, user-directed; appended after B14, no renumber)

**Why (the cost driver, measured):** the LS transonic **Picard**
(`solve_multivalued_transonic`) is a Mach ramp whose top levels park on the
**shock-position residual plateau** (the P4/B6/N5 soft mode) and burn their whole
outer budget there. On the 2026-07-15 M6-medium workflow solve the ramp is 7
levels (0.60→0.84, dm 0.04) and the embedded per-level cache shows levels **0.80
and 0.84 do NOT converge** — each runs its full 200-outer budget — which is the
bulk of the **24.5 min (embedded) / 38.4 min (wake-free)** wall clock. `tol_residual`
is already set to 1e-5 *above* the plateau (1e-7 would burn ~1 h). A Picard method
cannot do better: the plateau is intrinsic. **Newton has no shock-position soft
mode** — the demo's own note says "a strict-converged transonic wants the LS Newton
ramp". But `newton_ls` could not run a ramp: `freeze=` was a reserved no-op, the
convergence gate hard-requires 0 limited/floored (which shock limiter cells block),
and there was no Mach-ramp wrapper. B15 supplies all three.

**Gates**
- [x] **GB15.1 — frozen per-side selection + FD.** `MultivaluedOperator.newton_side_data(frozen=…)`
      + new `freeze_side_state` (per-side `(upstream, branch)` capture). The
      `kernels/upwind.py` frozen apparatus is reused **unmodified** — the per-side
      ops are plain walk-mode `UpwindOperator`s with a same-side-masked face graph
      — so this is wiring, not new numerics. Residual/Jacobian extracted into
      `LSNewtonSystem` so the solver and the FD gate share ONE assembly path.
      **FD: rel 6.7e-9** (eps 1e-5; clean round-off scaling 5.8e-8 / 6.0e-7 at
      1e-6 / 1e-7 ⇒ a true derivative), 96.9% of free rows kept by the ε-guard,
      on a real pocket (nu_max 0.785, 1118 elements on branches 1/2).
      Frozen sweep reproduces the live density **bitwise** at the freeze point.
- [x] **GB15.2 — the freeze cures the limit cycle, and does not move the answer.**
      ★ On **NACA coarse M0.75** the LIVE LS Newton **does not converge**: it parks
      in a genuine **period-6 limit cycle** (3.2e-7, 2.8e-7, 2.7e-7, 1.3e-6, 8.6e-7,
      4.3e-7, repeating) at |R|≈2.7e-7 — three orders above tol — with **0
      limited/floored** (a CLEAN stall = the assignment churn). Arming the freeze
      converts it to a converged solve: **22 steps → |R| 8.5e-13**, 0 reverts, and
      **γ 0.218809 vs the live cycle's 0.218804** ⇒ the freeze removes the churn, it
      does not select a different state.
      ★★ **TRIGGER ERRATUM (measured; the conforming recipe does NOT transfer):**
      `solve/newton.py` also freezes on `live_stalled`. Porting that verbatim makes
      the LS solver freeze a **still-MOVING** assignment — the LS live residual
      bounces ±2× for tens of steps *while still descending* (γ travels 0.183→0.243
      over that stretch: slow progress in a stiff direction, **not** a stall). The
      frozen step then diverges → revert → re-arm: **3 reverts, no convergence**, on
      a case (medium M0.75) the untouched live path converges (54 steps, 7.5e-12).
      With the stall trigger removed it freezes late (|R|<1e-6, assignment settled)
      and converges: **53 steps, 2.1e-12, 0 reverts, exactly the live γ 0.243305**,
      with `residual_unfrozen` 2.1e-12 confirming the LIVE selection agrees there.
      ⇒ **the freeze arms on `freeze_tol` ALONE.** Fail-safes added: disarm after
      `freeze_max_reverts` (3) so the freeze can only ever HELP, never cost
      convergence; the reported `n_limited`/`n_floored` are always re-read LIVE
      (a frozen finish shows 0 floored BY DESIGN and can never be its own evidence).
- [ ] **GB15.3 — the Mach-ramp wrapper.** `solve_multivalued_newton_transonic`:
      upward `mach_schedule`, warm start from the last CONVERGED level only,
      dm-halving retry inserted BELOW a failed level and run STRICT, optional
      `upwind_c_post` staging, honest `target_reached`/`m_final` (the P13/G13.3
      erratum: never census a state whose ramp did not reach the target).
      `intermediate_tol` = loose stopping tol on intermediate levels, strict final.
      ★ **LS-specific: the freeze stays ARMED on loose intermediate levels**, unlike
      the conforming mask (`newton.py:888` sets `freeze_tol=None` there): the accept
      gate requires 0 limited/floored on EVERY route, and on a 0.60→0.84 ramp the
      shock forms MID-ramp, so those levels carry limiter cells and can only reach a
      0-clamped accept THROUGH a freeze. Loosen the tolerance, keep the mechanism.
      (The conforming fold contraindication — a loose level leaving an untracked Γ
      seed, G10.2 — has **no analogue here**: the LS path has no Γ DOF, Γ is a
      solution mode carried inside `phi_ext`.) A/B on NACA coarse M0.80 + fold.
- [x] **GB15.4 — M6 medium M0.84: the plateau is GONE, 3.5× faster.** ONERA M6
      medium wake-free (63,100 ext dofs), M0.84/α3.06. **Picard (committed):
      2304.7 s = 38.4 min, residual parked on the 1e-5..1e-4 plateau, top two
      levels burning their full 200-outer budget. Newton ramp (B15): 657.4 s =
      11.0 min (3.51×; committed `summary.csv` — an earlier draft's 672 s was a
      pre-CSV trial run), EVERY level converged to ~1e-11**, the freeze armed at
      every level with **0 reverts**. Per level: M0.60 ✓5 / 0.65 ✓19 / 0.70 ✓23 /
      0.75 ✓16 / 0.80 ✓19 / **0.84 ✓16 steps, |R| 6.9e-11**. Physics cross-checks
      against the committed Picard: **M_max 2.4938 vs 2.4549** (1.6%), **3 clamped
      cells of 330k vs Picard's ≤3**.
      ★ **HONEST LIMIT:** most levels accept via `assignment_cycle` — the FROZEN
      system converges to ~1e-11 and is accepted at the **assignment-discontinuity
      floor** (the live residual stops improving across refreshes). That is the
      N5 semantics the conforming path also uses; it is **NOT** a claim that the
      LIVE residual is below 1e-10. It beats the Picard plateau by 6–7 orders,
      but "live-strict solution" would be an over-claim.
      ⇒ Closes the deferred **B6-medium quantitative** and **B7-quantitative**
      items (the LS Newton on M6 was DEFERRED at B7).

★★ **FOUR ERRATA — porting the conforming N5 recipe is NOT mechanical** (the same
lesson B8 taught). Every one was forced out by measurement, none was foreseen:
1. **The TE polyline must come from the AUTHORITATIVE geometry.** A hand-rolled
   `x_te(0)=0.8059` vs `wing3d.x_te(0)=0.80611` — off by **2e-4**. `CutElementMap`
   finds TE nodes by matching the polyline onto WALL NODES (M2: the M6 TE endpoints
   are exact wall nodes), so 2e-4 matches **nothing** ⇒ **0 TE nodes ⇒ no Kutta ⇒ Γ
   unpinned ⇒ 340k limited cells + NaN** — and the solver **passed silently**.
   ⇒ Both LS solvers now **raise** on `te_nodes == 0`, pointing at `meshgen.wing3d`.
2. **★ `freeze_tol` must sit ABOVE the CHURN FLOOR, and that floor RISES with Mach**
   (measured: **<1e-6 at M0.60 → 8.6e-6 at M0.65 → 2.7e-4 at M0.70**). Below it, a
   discrete upwind-selection flip throws the residual back before the freeze can arm
   (measured: clean descent to 8.6e-6, then ×300 to **the same value 2.6e-3, twice** —
   the signature of a discrete flip) and the ramp dies. **Same law as "tol_residual
   must sit above the Picard plateau".**
3. **★ Residuals are NOT comparable across a SELECTION EPOCH.** The frozen phase
   drives `r_best` to 1.5e-11; after a refresh the residual legitimately returns to
   the live scale (2.6e-3), and the fail-fast (`res > 100*r_best`) reads a 1e8×
   "blow-up" and kills a perfectly healthy freeze-refresh cycle. ⇒ `r_best` is reset
   on every freeze / refresh / revert.
4. **★ The frozen phase's clamp count is STALE BY CONSTRUCTION and must not gate
   acceptance.** Under a freeze `n_floored` counts `branch==3` = the cells clamped
   **at the freeze point**; it never falls. Gating on `n_flr == 0` therefore
   **refuses a 7.8e-14 machine-precision solution forever** (measured at M0.70: the
   freeze cured the period-7 limit cycle, the floored cell **cleared itself** in the
   live field — final live `lim/flr = 0/0` — and the gate still would not fire).
   ⇒ The frozen phase need only be no worse than at the freeze; the **LIVE
   re-evaluation** in the honesty branch is the arbiter (and it is strict).

★ **New knob `freeze_max_clamped`** (default **0** = the conforming N5 rule, bit-identical). At M6 medium M0.70 a **single** persistently-floored cell (of 330k) blocks the freeze at **any** `freeze_tol`. The frozen sweep **represents a clamped cell exactly** (branch 3: `nu=0`, `rho=rho_floor`, `s_e=s_u=0` — a flat clamp with zero derivative), so the 0-clamped precondition is stricter than the machinery needs; relaxing it lets the freeze arm and the ramp completes.
⚠ **TWO CORRECTIONS to an earlier draft of this entry (2026-07-15, self-caught):**
  (a) **The clamped cells do NOT "clear themselves".** That was over-generalised from ONE isolated 80-step run at M0.70 (driven to 7.8e-14, ending 0/0). In the SHIPPED ramp — which accepts at `assignment_cycle` after ~23 steps — the cells **PERSIST**: M0.70 `0/1`, M0.75 `0/1`, M0.80 `1/1`, **M0.84 `1/2` = 3 clamped cells** (which is exactly the Picard's ≤3, so it is consistent, not alarming). The freeze proceeds **WITH** them present.
  (b) **The convergence semantics ARE relaxed** — the earlier "the convergence gate is untouched" was FALSE. With `freeze_max_clamped > 0` the `assignment_cycle` / `refresh_budget` accept routes do NOT re-check the clamp count, so the returned `converged=True` M0.84 state **carries 3 clamped cells of 330k**. Only the strict `tol` route still demands live 0-limited/0-floored. State this whenever the M6 number is quoted.
⚠ **P9/G9.1 is CITED, NOT RE-TESTED.** P9/G9.1 records that permanently-**limited** cells block the N5 freeze machinery on the CONFORMING path; our blocker at M6 medium is mostly **floored** cells — the same *precondition*, a different clamp. `freeze_max_clamped` exists **only on the LS path** (`newton.py` still has the hard 0-clamped rule), and whether relaxing it would unblock G9.1's conforming fine mesh is an **UNTESTED HYPOTHESIS**, not a result. Do not cite B15 as having revived G9.1.

**Bit-identity:** `freeze_tol=None` (default) + `tol_residual_loose/rel=None` +
`accept_on_stall=False` ⇒ the pre-B15 live solver, byte-identical (locked).
Tests `tests/test_b15_ls_newton_freeze.py` (12 — 11 at closure + the 2026-07-15
errata lock `test_freeze_max_clamped_relaxes_the_convergence_semantics`).

Working rules (DN1 §9–§10):

- **No big-bang rewrite.** `solve/picard_ls.py` lives alongside
  `solve_subsonic_lifting`; the suite runs both paths parameterized; the default
  flips per-phase only after that phase's gate.
- **Dual-mesh testing (NEW 2026-07-11, user-directed;
  design_track_b.md §5.7).** Every B1–B6 gate runs on BOTH mesh types:
  (a) the existing wake-embedded meshes (M0/M1 — the "C-grid" analogue: nodes
  lie exactly on the wake plane, exercising the ε side-shift at scale, and
  enabling strict same-mesh A/B against the conforming path), and (b) the
  wake-free meshes (the "O-grid" analogue: generic cuts through generic
  elements — the actual workflow target): **M3** quasi-2D and **M4** ONERA M6.
  Where no conforming counterpart exists, acceptance compares against the (a)
  results and external references. The 3D pair (M1/M4) is not optional
  cosmetics: the swept TE and the wing tip carry machinery — oblique span
  frame, spanwise clip (Γ(tip)=0) — that the quasi-2D meshes cannot exercise
  at all, and B1 found a real defect in exactly that machinery.
- **Sequencing guard vs P8 (recorded 2026-07-10; wording updated 2026-07-11).**
  The P8 fully-coupled Newton is designed on the *conforming* wake (the
  Γ-Jacobian blocks come from `wake.py::self._h`; design.md §8.1), while B3's
  implicit Kutta removes the Γ DOF entirely. Land P8 on the conforming path
  first (done — P8 closed 2026-07-11); a level-set Newton is a post-B6
  re-derivation, not a parallel design (design_track_b.md §5.5: the wake-LS
  Jacobian blocks are constant in φ, no Γ elimination/Woodbury needed) —
  Track B blocks nothing in P7–P12.

### B16 — LS Newton far-field BC generalisation (far-field aux-DOF pin) ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-17 (NEW, user-directed; appended after B15, no renumber; executes the B9 recorded follow-up)

**Why (the B9 recorded follow-up, now measured — not prose).** B9 shipped its
LS leg on Picard because the LS Newton churns on the wing-body (medium Picard
**1458.9 s** vs the conforming Newton's 52.4 s), and recorded the diagnostic —
"`neumann` res→1e43, freestream Newton 8 far-field fluid rows |R|≈84" — as
prose only ("Findings recorded in memory", commit 555cfd8), which violates
session-discipline #3. B16 reproduces it as a committed artifact AND fixes it.

**Root cause (GB16.1, measured; corrects the pre-registered proposal).** A wake
level set has **no outflow clip** (`cut_elements.py`: a crossing need only be
downstream of the TE and within the span), so the sheet reaches the far-field
boundary and the outer nodes it crosses each carry an aux DOF governed only by a
**near-singular wake-LS row on a giant outer tet**. At the converged freestream
Picard state those aux hold garbage (coarse wing-body: |jump| **53.4** at x≥10
vs the physical Γ̄ **0.0586**); the Picard fixed point tolerates it (it solves
those rows to zero garbage-and-all), but the Newton residual reads it as an O(1)
inconsistency — **exactly the 8 far-field MAIN rows, max|R| = 84.457** (reproduced
to the digit). The aux-block conditioning is the single-number tell:
`jaa_diagnostic` cond1 = **6.36e18** (legacy free-aux — ABOVE the GB14.1 1e14
ceiling, i.e. genuinely singular) → **8.70e6** (pinned). ⚠ **The proposal's
mechanism was wrong**: it attributed Picard's success to `closure="continuity"`
(weld) vs Newton's `wake_ls`, but the lifting/transonic Picard uses `wake_ls`
too (weld is only the Laplace seed) — both paths carry the same aux rows; the
difference is that Picard's fixed point absorbs the near-singular rows and
Newton's residual does not.

**Fix = `farfield_aux="pin"` (default) on `solve_multivalued_newton`, mode-adaptive
(user-arbitrated).** On a Dirichlet far field (freestream/vortex, where the
far-field MAIN DOFs are already Dirichlet) the far-field-BOUNDARY aux enter the
Dirichlet set at the branch value their host carries: freestream → the same
single-valued φ∞ (jump→0, consistent with the freestream BC already suppressing
circulation at a 25-MAC boundary); vortex → `main − side·γ` refreshed per step
(jump→γ, the conforming `lower_branch_mask` analogue, side from
`cm.node_side ∈ {±1}` — distinct from the B3 negative result, which pinned BOTH
sides to one branch and drained the circulation). **`neumann` is byte-identical
either way** (its outer aux ARE constrained by the wake-LS rows there, and every
committed LS-Newton anchor uses neumann), so the default flip is vacuous on all
committed evidence. New helper `farfield_aux_dofs(mesh, cm)` (`solve/picard_ls.py`).

**Gates**

- [x] **GB16.1 — diagnostic (evidence-debt repayment).** Committed script
  reproduces the churn on the coarse wing-body Picard state: max|R[free]| =
  **84.457**, 8 outer MAIN rows |R|>1 in the x∈[7,13] wake corridor, junk aux
  |jump| **53.4** at x≥10 vs Γ̄ 0.0586, cond1 **6.36e18 → 8.70e6** under the pin.
  D8: the pin drives the outer jumps to **5.3e-15** — and ★ cures the 4 INTERIOR
  junk aux too (their wake-LS rows now anchor to clean Dirichlet data), so the
  R2 "interior aux unpinned" risk did not materialize.
- [x] **GB16.2 — wing-alone / neumann not perturbed.** naca coarse M0.7 neumann
  is `np.array_equal(phi_ext)` pin vs legacy (test); the B12 anchor
  (`onera_m6/medium` M0.5 neumann γ **0.06685284**) and the B15 ramp anchor
  (`onera_m6_wakefree/medium` M0.84 γ **0.088338**, M_max 2.4938, the
  freeze_max_clamped=8 / 3-clamped caveat unchanged) are the gated tier.
- [x] **GB16.3 — wing-body freestream Newton converges (coarse ✓; medium
  gated).** Coarse M0.5: legacy churns (res **7.95**, 3690 limited) → pin reaches
  **res 5.88e-14, 0 limited** with the outer jumps at 5.3e-15. The BC layer is
  the fix. ⚠ **HONEST LIMIT (pre-registered branch, band NOT moved):** the pin
  state carries `n_flr=3`, so the strict `converged` flag (which needs 0 floored)
  does not fire — but D5 places those 3 cells at the wing-fuselage junction as
  the **B8 mixed-plain junk / G1.6 fuselage-Cp** class (M²_side 7.32 vs M²_main
  0.29; max honest M²_main 1.273 at the junction), the SAME root as **GB9.4**'s
  fuselage-lift xfail — a pre-existing issue orthogonal to the far-field BC fix,
  not created by B16. Recorded, not chased (G1.6 fix routes are closed negatives).
  ★ **And the coarse machine-converged lift is RIGHT:** cl_p(wing) **0.2086**
  vs the conforming **0.2089** (0.1%) — a properly converged Newton-pin agrees
  with the independent conforming path. (The medium is a different story — see
  GB16.4 and the ★★ block: the medium Newton STALLS and its lift is 22% low.)
- [ ] **GB16.4 — Newton-pin vs Picard vs conforming lift (XFAIL — the OPEN
  non-convergence).** The lift triangle does NOT close consistently, and the
  alignment FLIPS with resolution (all cl_p, wing): **coarse** the
  machine-converged Newton-pin **0.2086** matches conforming **0.2089** (0.1%)
  while LS Picard 0.1853 is the low outlier; **medium** the Newton-pin STALLS at
  res 7e-6 with **0.1690** — 22% BELOW both LS Picard **0.2165** and conforming
  **0.2173**, which agree (B9's 0.4% headline). ⇒ at least one path is NOT
  converged (see the ★★ block below). XFAIL: this is the open state, not a pass.
- [x] **GB16.5 — Schur/B14 compatible.** `SchurReducedSystem(...,
  n_aux_expected=mvop.n_ext − ff_aux_dofs.size)`: the pinned aux leave a
  contiguous free-aux tail; the split constructs and still fails loudly on the
  un-adjusted (legacy) count. `pytest tests/test_b14_schur_ls.py` stays green.
- [~] **GB16.6 — transonic wing-body stretch (RECORDED, gated).** wingbody
  freestream + a B15-style ramp to M0.84; records target_reached / death level /
  whether the death is the BC layer or the shock — no pass/fail. ★ **B18 erratum
  (2026-07-18): GB16.6 was spec'd "RECORDED" but NEVER implemented** (no demo
  code, no checks row — an evidence debt, discipline #3). **B18 executes it** and
  the answer is a NEGATIVE: the LS ramp dies at the wing-fuselage junction
  (coarse ~M0.575, medium at the first level ~M0.5, Mmax artifact growing with
  refinement — the G1.6/GB9.4 class), NOT at the BC layer or a wing shock. See B18.

★★ **RESOLVED BY B17 (2026-07-18) — it was NOT a non-convergence, it was a
BC-modelling error in the freestream pin.** See the **B17** section below. The
short version: `farfield_aux="pin"` on a freestream far field forces the outflow
wake jump to **0**, which REMOVES the circulation the wake physically carries out
— a resolution-dependent lift error, not a solver stall. Proof it is not a stall:
an independent **Picard** pin converges cleanly (res 7.5e-8) to the SAME medium
0.1691 the Newton-pin "stalls" at (0.1690) — both solvers agree per-BC. The coarse
"match to conforming" was a coincidence (jump=0 there cancelled the coarse legacy's
outer-tet garbage). The fix is `farfield_aux="pin_gamma"` (jump→γ): coarse
0.2087 / medium 0.2117 (Picard) and 0.2115 (Newton), **monotone** to conforming,
both solvers agreeing to 0.1%. The residual junction churn (nlim/nflr at the
wing-fuselage junction, G1.6/GB9.4 class) survives but no longer corrupts the
lift. The original (now-superseded) diagnosis is kept below for the record.

★★ ~~UNRESOLVED NON-CONVERGENCE~~ (user-flagged 2026-07-18 — superseded by B17).
The far-field aux pin definitively fixes the **churn** — a self-contained result
on its own evidence (cond1 O(1e19)→8.7e6, res 84→**machine at coarse**, 0
limited vs legacy's 3690, and the coarse converged lift matches conforming to
0.1%). But comparing the LIFT across the three paths exposes a discrepancy the
pin does NOT resolve, and it FLIPS with resolution:
- **coarse:** the machine-converged Newton-pin (0.2086) ≈ conforming (0.2089);
  LS Picard (0.1853) is the low outlier.
- **medium:** LS Picard (0.2165) ≈ conforming (0.2173) — B9's headline — and the
  Newton-pin (0.1690, STALLED at res 7e-6, not machine) is the low outlier, 22%
  below.
The {Newton-pin, Picard, conforming} triangle therefore does **not** close
consistently ⇒ **at least one path is not converged.** Two live possibilities,
neither ruled out: **(a)** the medium Newton-pin is simply non-converged (it
stalls at 7e-6; a warm start from the *converged* B9 Picard state also failed to
converge within ~10 min, so it is NOT merely a shallow cold seed); **(b)** the
B9 medium LS-Picard≈conforming 0.4% agreement could itself be a non-converged
coincidence (both stopping near, but not at, a truly converged state). The
coarse evidence (converged Newton-pin ≈ conforming) favours (a), but does not
settle it. **UNRESOLVED — the medium-convergence / lift-consistency problem is
the open B16 follow-up; analysis deferred (user).** B16's churn fix stands; the
"the LS Newton now matches the other paths" claim does **not** — do not make it.

★ **New knob `farfield_aux` (default `"pin"`).** Defensible-as-default:
freestream Newton was NEVER exercised before B9 (the `ff_vals=None` bug made it
non-finite until 695baa0), vortex Newton has zero committed recipes, and neumann
is byte-identical — so "default leaves every committed anchor bit-identical"
holds vacuously. `"legacy"` is kept as the GB16.1 pathology reproduction switch.

**Bit-identity:** `farfield="neumann"` and `farfield_aux="legacy"` are
byte-identical to pre-B16 (locked: `test_neumann_bit_identical_pin_vs_legacy`,
and the b12/b13/b14/b15 neumann suites all pass unchanged). `schur_ls.py` changed
docstring/error text only (the assert body is preserved).
Tests `tests/test_b16_farfield_aux.py` (9, incl. gated GB16.3).

Working rules (DN1 §9–§10): the no-big-bang / dual-mesh / P8-sequencing block
above (B15) applies unchanged — B16 touches only the LS Newton far-field wiring
and one pure-query helper; the conforming path and the Picard drivers are
byte-untouched.

### B17 — Far-field aux pin carries jump=γ, not 0 (resolves GB16.4) ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-18 (NEW, user-directed; appended after B16, no renumber; executes the B16 GB16.4 open follow-up)

**GB16.4 was NOT a non-convergence — it was a boundary-condition modelling error
in the B16 freestream pin.** The B16 pin, on `farfield="freestream"`, forced the
outflow wake potential-jump to **0**. Physically the wake carries its jump
[φ]=Γ out to the boundary; zeroing it **removes the outflow circulation**, a
resolution-dependent lift error. This was invisible at coarse (the jump=0 error
happened to cancel the coarse legacy's near-singular outer-tet garbage) and
un-masked at medium (where the legacy wake-LS already carries the jump correctly,
so the pin's error dominates: −22%).

**Decisive discriminator (E2): both solvers agree per-BC.** Giving the *Picard*
driver the same freestream pin (new `farfield_aux` knob on
`solve_multivalued_lifting`) makes medium Picard-pin converge cleanly (res 7.5e-8,
34 outers) to **cl_p 0.1691** — matching the "stalled" Newton-pin **0.1690** to
0.1%. Two independent solvers landing on the same value ⇒ it is a genuine
(BC-determined) state, **not** a Newton stall. So B16's possibility (a) was wrong;
the pin fixed point itself is wrong.

**The fix — `farfield_aux="pin_gamma"` (jump→γ), the new default.** aux = host
φ∞ − side·γ, refreshed with the live γ (Picard: per outer; Newton: per step) — the
same near-singular-aux Dirichlet cure B16 correctly identified, but with the
physical ring value. The triangle then closes and is **monotone** to conforming:

| far-field aux | coarse cl_p | medium cl_p | trend |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| conforming (P14 Newton, ref) | 0.2089 | 0.2173 | ↑ |
| legacy (free aux) | 0.1853 | 0.2165 | coarse polluted by \|jump\|=53 outer tet |
| pin jump=0 (B16) | 0.2086 | 0.1690 | ✗ non-monotone, kills outflow circ |
| **pin_gamma (B17)** | **0.2087** | **0.2117** (Picard) / **0.2115** (Newton) | ✓ monotone |

Newton-pin_gamma and Picard-pin_gamma agree to 0.1% at both resolutions; both
undershoot conforming by 0.1%/2.6% (far-field truncation). The medium
Newton-pin_gamma still carries the wing-fuselage-junction churn (nlim 42 / nflr 40,
res 5.5e-5, the **G1.6/GB9.4** class) — but the lift is now correct regardless
(γ stable 0.06420, cl_p 0.2115). ★ **B16 conflated two orthogonal issues:** the
far-field near-singular *conditioning* (which the pin cures, jump value
irrelevant) and the outflow *circulation* (which needs jump=γ). The junction churn
is a third, pre-existing issue that only limits the residual floor, not the lift.

- [x] **GB17.1 — coarse 4-way triangle + ring-jump collapse.** pin_gamma 0.2087
  ≈ conforming 0.2089 (0.1%); the ring jump collapses legacy **53.4** → pin **0** →
  pin_gamma **0.063** = γ; and the coarse **legacy** garbage (\|jump\|=53) is a 12%
  lift deficit ⇒ B9's "coarse 12.8% = resolution" was largely far-field
  **contamination** (see the B9 erratum).
- [x] **GB17.2 — post-processing NOT the cause.** cl_p (surface-pressure integral)
  and cl_KJ (circulation integral) move together (~22% both at medium) ⇒ the pin
  gap is a genuine flow-state change, not a post artifact. The user's suspicion
  (Cp "looks aligned" yet cl_p differs) is a Cp-axis scale illusion: the plotted
  sectional cl(z) is the **Γ-based** `2Γ/(u·c)`, and per-station ∫Cp differs
  24–44% while the Cp curves differ only ~0.03–0.05 on a ±1 axis.
- [x] **GB17.3 — pin jump=0 is a BC error, both solvers.** medium Picard-pin-jump0
  0.169 ≡ B16 Newton-pin-jump0 0.1690 ⇒ GB16.4 is a BC-modelling error, not a stall.
- [x] **GB17.4 — pin_gamma closes the triangle.** Newton 0.2115 ≈ Picard 0.2117
  (<1%), monotone coarse→medium toward conforming.
- [x] **GB17.5 — spanwise Γ(z) uniform offset removed (RECORDED).** the jump=0
  spanwise Γ is a uniform multiplicative deficit (~22% at every station); pin_gamma
  restores it.
- [x] **GB17.6 — vortex evaluation (RECORDED, user-requested).** `farfield="vortex"`
  does NOT close the residual gap — it **brackets** conforming from the other side
  (medium **+2.5%** vs pin_gamma's −2.6%) and its free far-field aux **churn at
  coarse** (res 3.2, \|jump\|=71, needs its own pin). The 2–3% is far-field
  truncation; **freestream pin_gamma stays recommended** (clean at both resolutions).

**Defaults (user-arbitrated 2026-07-18):** `farfield_aux="pin_gamma"` is the new
default on BOTH `solve_multivalued_newton` (was `"pin"`) and
`solve_multivalued_lifting` (was free/legacy). Safety: it acts **only** on
`farfield="freestream"`, and is inert (bit-identical to legacy) on vortex/neumann
— so every committed 2.5D NACA vortex/neumann Picard run and every neumann Newton
anchor is byte-untouched. The B9/B16 **freestream** Picard demos were pinned to
explicit `farfield_aux="legacy"` to keep their committed numbers reproducible; a
**B9 erratum** records that coarse 12.8% was contamination (its medium
legacy≈conforming headline stands — legacy happens to carry the jump correctly at
medium). B16's committed jump=0 numbers reproduce with explicit `farfield_aux="pin"`.
`"pin"` (jump=0) is kept as the diagnostic value.

Tests `tests/test_b17_farfield_pin_gamma.py` (6, ungated); demo
`cases/demo/b17_farfield_pin_gamma/` (Part 1–2 coarse ungated, Part 3 medium gated).
The B16 tests are unchanged except `test_farfield_aux_knob` (default is now
`pin_gamma`).

### B18 — Wing-body transonic (M0.84): conforming reaches it, level-set is junction-limited ✓ CLOSED 2026-07-18 (NEW, user-directed; appended after B17, no renumber; executes the GB16.6 debt)

**The wing-body transonic capability is asymmetric, and that is the finding.**
Subsonic M0.5 wing-body is done (B9/B17). Pushing the Mach up:

- **Conforming (Newton + pressure Kutta, Mach continuation) IS the wing-body
  transonic path.** coarse reaches **M0.84 (cl_p 0.2617**, Mmax 2.15, strict
  res 2.8e-12); medium reaches **M0.79 STRICT (cl_p 0.2579**, res 2.2e-14), with
  a clean transonic rise cl_p(M) = **0.2173 / 0.2321 / 0.2579** at M0.50/0.65/0.79.
  Medium **M0.80+ stalls** (res ~2–7e-6, 0 clamp) — NOT slivers (the medium mesh
  is clean, min_dihedral 9.75°, 0 tets < 5°; the coarse mesh has 27 slivers yet
  reaches 0.84), a sharper shock/junction interaction; recorded, not chased.
- **Level-set (B15 freeze-ramp + B17 pin_gamma) does NOT reach transonic on the
  wing-body.** The wing-fuselage junction carries a spurious supersonic pocket
  (the **G1.6/GB9.4/B8 mixed-plain** class — M²≈1.27 already at M0.5) that
  **WORSENS with refinement**: coarse ceiling **M0.575** (Mmax 1.44), medium dies
  at the FIRST transonic level ~**M0.5** (Mmax artifact 3.96, nlim 43/nflr 40).
  This is a **closed-negative discretization error** (discipline #8), characterized
  not chased — and it is the direct analogue of GB9.4's "LS fuselage lift GROWS
  0.164→0.205 with refinement."

Consequence: there is **no common transonic Mach at medium** (LS cannot leave
0.5), so the trustworthy cross-model check stays **M0.5 (B9/B17: 2.6%)**. A coarse
transonic cross-model point was targeted at M0.60 but SKIPPED (LS coarse ceiling
0.575 < 0.60) — recorded honestly.

- [x] **GB18.1 — conforming transonic (PASS).** coarse M0.84 0.2617
  (proof-of-concept, under-resolved); medium M0.79 0.2579 strict, monotone cl(M)
  rise. The wing-body transonic deliverable.
- [~] **GB18.2 — LS transonic ceiling (RECORDED).** coarse ~M0.575, medium ~M0.5;
  the GB16.6 debt repaid as a negative (junction, not BC layer).
- [~] **GB18.3 — cross-model (RECORDED).** M0.5 medium (2.6%) is the only
  trustworthy cross-model; the medium transonic cross-model is BLOCKED by the LS
  junction, and that is the finding.
- [~] **GB18.4 — junction transonic characterization (RECORDED).** the spurious
  pocket grows with refinement (coarse Mmax 1.4 → medium 4.0), GB9.4 sign.
- [~] **GB18.5 — fuselage lift at the medium transonic top (RECORDED).** cl_fus
  16% of wing cl_p at M0.79 — the G1.6 flat-facet natural-BC error persists into
  transonic (GB9.4 class).

★ **No `pyfp3d/` numerics change** — B18 is a pure demo/tests/docs phase using the
existing conforming `solve_newton_transonic` and LS `solve_multivalued_newton_transonic`
(the B15 ramp with B17 pin_gamma). ★ **Recipe note:** the conforming wing-body
medium ramp needs `freeze_tol` raised to the wing-body churn floor (1e-6 → 1e-5,
the B17 lesson) or it stalls at M0.80 with the wing-alone recipe. ★ **fine
excluded** (G13.3 negative + LS has no fine escape). Tests
`tests/test_b18_wingbody_transonic.py` (4, ungated); demo
`cases/demo/b18_wingbody_transonic/` (7 gated gates: 1 PASS + 6 RECORDED).

### B19 — LS Newton Jacobian exactness on mixed-side plain elements ◐ OPEN 2026-07-18 (NEW, user-directed; appended after B18, no renumber; executes the A3/GA3.6 C1 finding)

**Trigger.** A3 verified the 2026-07-17 inspection's C1 (evidence:
`cases/analysis/c1_ls_jacobian_fd/`, demo_report/track_a.md §A3): on 3-D meshes
the LS Newton Jacobian is **not** the derivative of its residual on
**mixed-side plain elements** — targeted probe ‖Jv−FD‖/‖FD‖ **1.146e-01** vs
control **6.33e-10**, and **ε-independent** (1.532e-01 at ε 1e-6/1e-7/1e-8,
max/min 1.00) ⇒ a missing term, not FD noise. 3378 such elements on M6 coarse.
R is untouched by a Jacobian error, so every converged state and gate number
stands; what degrades is the convergence RATE (a quasi-Newton in 3-D).

**★ The phase is TWO problems, deliberately separated (user-arbitrated
2026-07-18). Do not merge the legs — merging them makes any result
unattributable.**

**Root cause (re-derived from the code, not transcribed).** One element has
TWO different DOF maps, and Terms 2/3 use one map for both roles:

- **Row map** — where the element's residual LANDS. `mass_conservation_coo`
  scatters plain elements onto **main** DOFs (`cut_assembly.py:173`), cut
  elements onto `dofs_upper`/`dofs_lower`.
- **Column map** — which DOFs the element's side FIELD READS.
  `side_potentials` (`multivalued.py:381-382`) is a **per-NODE** rule: a cut
  node takes the **aux** value on the opposite side. `newton_side_data`
  computes the gradient from that side field (`multivalued.py:562`
  `grad, q2 = self.op.velocities(phi_s)`), so ρ — and hence the residual —
  really does depend on those aux DOFs.

`_side_dofvecs` (`multivalued.py:509,513`) applies its override only to
`cm.cut_elems`; plain elements keep main connectivity on both sides. So
`newton_terms23_side_coo` (`cut_assembly.py:441-456`) scatters the aux
sensitivity onto a **main** column. **For cut elements the two maps coincide**
— which is exactly why the 2.5-D FD gate passes and why this survived to B18.

#### Leg A — make J exact for the R we have (low risk, do FIRST)

Split the two roles: rows keep `dofvec` (the mass-conservation scatter),
columns become a new per-side **read map** mirroring `side_potentials`
node-by-node, for ALL elements:

    read_u = where(node_side[el] == +1, el, ext_dof_of_node[el])
    read_l = where(node_side[el] == -1, el, ext_dof_of_node[el])
    # ext_dof_of_node < 0 (non-cut node) falls back to main

Term 2: rows `dofvec[e]`, cols `read[e]`. Term 3: rows `dofvec[e]`, cols
`read[u(e)]`. ★ **This is not a new rule — on cut elements `read_u`/`read_l`
reproduce `dofs_upper`/`dofs_lower` exactly** (assert it), so the fix
generalizes the existing per-element special case into the per-node rule it
should always have been. That equivalence is the strongest evidence the fix is
right, and it is gated below.

★★ **The index split is only HALF of it — a SECOND missing term, found by
measurement (2026-07-18).** After the row/column index split the targeted probe
still read 1.4697e-02 (from 1.146e-01) and was still ε-independent. A
column-wise FD localization, then a block isolation that rebuilt Terms 2 and 3
separately, showed `|FD23 − J23| ≡ |FD23 − J2|` **exactly** on most touched aux
columns ⇒ **Term 3 contributes nothing there** (those elements are subsonic,
s_u = 0) ⇒ the残 error is in **Term 2**, not the upstream coupling the first
row-classification had suggested. ★ *This is why the localization was run
instead of reasoning from the row/element classification: the first reading of
that classification pointed at Term 3 and was wrong.*

The mechanism, and it is the same duality one level down — **not just the DOF
indices but the GRADIENT FACTORS come from two different fields**. An element's
residual contribution is

    R_a(e) = rho_tilde( grad of the READ field ) * V_e * ( grad of the
             SCATTER field . B_a )

— the density is built from the side field, but the `K @ phi` that it weights
is contracted with the field the SCATTER map reads (main, for a plain element).
Terms 2/3 used the side gradient for **both** factors. So the fix is: the ROW
factor uses `grad_row` = the gradient over `phi_ext[dofvec]`, the COLUMN factor
keeps `grad` = the side field's. On cut elements `phi_ext[dofs_upper]` IS
`phi_up` over that element, so the two gradients coincide and nothing moves —
the same reason the index split was inert there.

- [x] **GB19.1 — the C1 measurement inverts ✓ PASS** (`results/c1_fd_probes.csv`
  post-fix, `c1_fd_probes_prefix.csv` pre-fix, `b19_three_states.csv` = the
  three-state ledger). Targeted probe **1.145684e-01 → 1.333699e-08**; control
  6.327479e-10 unchanged; global-free **2.47e-03 → 8.49e-10**.
  ★★ **The discriminator FLIPPED, and that is the real proof.** The same ε
  sweep that convicted the code now acquits it: pre-fix **1.532e-01 at every ε**
  (spread 1.00 = a missing term); post-fix **1.6e-09 / 2.1e-08 / 2.2e-07**
  (spread 131.5, scaling like 1/ε = pure FD roundoff, the numerical floor). An
  ε-independent error became an ε-sensitive one — exactly the transition a real
  fix must produce, and one no amount of tolerance-loosening could fake.
  ★ **The intermediate state is recorded, not erased:** after the index split
  ALONE the probe read **1.4697e-02** — 8× better, still ε-independent
  (2.913917e-02 at all three ε) ⇒ held open as PARTIAL rather than rounded into
  a pass, which is what forced the second defect to be found.
  ★ **Ruled out along the way:** `_side_element_sets` uses the *same*
  `node_side.max() == 1` rule as `mass_conservation_coo`, so the side-set
  assignment was never a second inconsistency.
- [ ] **GB19.2 — R is BIT-IDENTICAL (the load-bearing claim).** On a fixed
  φ_ext, the assembled residual before and after must agree bit for bit on a
  3-D mesh. This is what licenses "no converged answer moves"; assert it, do
  not infer it.
- [ ] **GB19.3 — `read_*` ≡ `dofs_upper`/`dofs_lower` on cut elements**, and
  the 2.5-D Jacobian is bit-identical (quasi-2D has no mixed-side plain
  elements ⇒ J itself must not move). Full ungated suite unchanged.
- [ ] **GB19.4 — the 3-D convergence delta, recorded honestly. ◐ post-fix
  measured, A/B in progress.** M6 coarse M0.5→0.70 freestream LS Newton,
  n_seed 30 / n_newton_max 40 / tol 1e-8: **does NOT reach tol** — it settles
  into a clean PERIODIC plateau at **~3.5e-07** (residual cycling 3.31e-07 …
  4.12e-07 with an obvious period), **0 limited / 0 floored**, γ 0.07212068,
  M_max 1.134, 62.8 s.
  ★ **That plateau is the B15 upwind selection/branch churn limit cycle, not a
  Jacobian defect** — with 0 limited/0 floored and a periodic residual, the
  iteration is bouncing between assignments, which is exactly the object B15's
  freeze machinery was built to cure (this run deliberately used no freeze, to
  observe the raw Newton). An exact Jacobian cannot fix a discontinuous
  selection: **the fix removes the wrong-derivative error, it does not remove
  the churn floor, and those are different problems.** Recording this so the
  phase does not get credited with a convergence improvement it did not make.
  ★★ **A/B COMPLETE — the exact Jacobian changes NOTHING measurable here, and
  that is the finding.** Same case, same driver, stash A/B:

  | | steps | converged | residual | γ | M_max | wall |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | pre-fix (J wrong) | 40 | False | 3.707261e-07 | 0.07212068 | 1.134235 | 60.6 s |
  | post-fix (J exact) | 40 | False | 3.973387e-07 | **0.07212068** | **1.134235** | 62.8 s |

  **γ identical to 8 decimals, M_max to 6** (as GB19.2's bit-identical R
  requires), the plateau sits at the same level — the two residuals differ only
  by which phase of the limit cycle step 40 lands on — and the step count is
  unchanged. Cost of exactness: **+3.6 % wall** (the extra `grad_row` einsum
  per side per step).
  ⇒ **The phase must NOT be credited with a convergence improvement.** The
  binding constraint on this case is the selection churn, which an exact
  derivative cannot touch. What B19 Leg A buys is **correctness** — the driver
  is now a Newton method rather than a quasi-Newton, so its behaviour is
  analysable and its future improvement (freeze, better preconditioning) rests
  on a true Jacobian. Whether that pays off anywhere is unmeasured, and this
  gate deliberately does not claim it.
- [x] **GB19.5 — a 3-D FD gate enters the suite** (`tests/test_b19_jacobian_3d.py`;
  the heavy FD gate itself gated, two structural checks ungated), so this
  element class can never regress unseen again. ★ This gate exists because the
  ROOT process failure was a structural blind spot — fixing the bug without
  fixing the blind spot would leave the trap armed.
  ★★ **ERRATUM, measured 2026-07-18 — the blind spot was MIS-STATED, by the C1
  write-up and by this author's first version of the test.** The claim was
  "quasi-2-D has no mixed-side plain elements". **It has 129** (coarse). What it
  has **zero** of is the subset that can reach an aux DOF: **0 of those 129
  touch a cut node**. A mixed-side plain element only mis-scatters when its
  side field actually READS an aux value, i.e. when one of its nodes is a cut
  node — that is the real invariant, and it is what the test now asserts. The
  coarser claim was wrong in fact while accidentally right in conclusion; it is
  corrected everywhere rather than quietly left standing (the P14 lesson: do
  not carry an attribution forward as if it were measured).

#### Leg B — is the R we have the R we want? (model question, do SECOND)

Leg A makes Newton exact for the CURRENT residual. It does not ask whether
that residual is right. For a mixed-side plain element the current R takes its
**stiffness from the main-field φ** but its **density from the side field** —
an asymmetry that was never a deliberate modelling decision on record.

- [x] **GB19.6 — characterized ✓, and the asymmetry is NOT benign** (zero-change
  probe `run_legb_probe.py`, `results/legb_density_gap.csv`; M6 coarse M0.70,
  Picard-400 state, |R| 1.95e-07).

  Scope first: of 3378 mixed-side plain elements only **252 actually read an
  aux DOF** — **0.1888 % of domain volume**. So this is a thin strip, and a
  small gap there would have argued for leaving R alone.

  **It is not small:**

  | metric | value |
  |---|---|
  | max \|ρ_side − ρ_main\| | **0.4474** (**45.3 %** relative) |
  | mean relative gap | 4.51 % (volume-weighted 0.0260 absolute) |
  | elements differing > 1 % / > 10 % | **154 / 39** of 252 |
  | **max q² read by the SIDE field** | **3.2229** (M ≈ 1.80, at the M_cap=3 limiter) |
  | **max q² read by the MAIN field** | **1.3379** (M ≈ 1.16) |

  ★★ **The last two rows are the finding.** On these elements the side field
  produces a **spurious supersonic state** where the main field is barely
  transonic — because the side field substitutes AUX values, which hold the
  flow on the OTHER side of the wake, into an element that is not cut and whose
  stiffness is assembled on main DOFs. The artificial-density switch then fires
  on that fictitious q², and the solver's own density — not merely a diagnostic
  — carries it.

  ★ **Same class, third bite.** B8 measured exactly this contamination as a ×5
  metric artifact in `element_mach2` (`element_mach2` reads mixed-side plain
  elements' side field; the honest exponent was +0.62, the artifact +1.34); A3
  found it in the Jacobian; this finds it in the residual's density.

  ★ **HYPOTHESIS, explicitly not a conclusion — a possible link to the
  junction/tip pockets.** B18 recorded that the level-set wing-body carries a
  spurious supersonic pocket that **worsens with refinement** (M² ≈ 1.27 at
  M0.5 coarse, M_max artifact 3.96 at medium), closed-negative as a
  discretization error. Spurious side-field supersonic states in the
  mixed-side plain strip are a *candidate* contributing mechanism with the
  right qualitative signature (more elements straddle as h falls). **This was
  measured on the wing-alone M6, NOT on the wing-body, and no causal link is
  demonstrated.** The named test would be: rerun the B18 medium level-set case
  with the main-field density on this element class and see whether M_max 3.96
  moves. **Do not repeat this hypothesis as a result** (the P14 lesson).

  **Routing: NOT adopted here, by design.** Changing the density source changes
  R ⇒ it moves every converged level-set answer, so it is a discretization
  change requiring its own phase with its own before/after on the committed
  cases (γ, cl_p, M_max, shock position, and the B18 pocket). Leg B's
  deliverable is the measured case for opening it — which the 45 % / spurious-
  supersonic numbers make, and which the 0.19 % volume share does not weaken,
  because the affected strip sits exactly where the tip and junction pathologies
  live.
- ★ **Prior art, same element class:** B8 measured a ×5 metric artifact from
  `element_mach2` reading mixed-side plain elements' side field
  (`b8-respec-negative-and-metric-artifact`). This class has now bitten twice —
  once in a metric, once in the Jacobian — which is itself the argument for
  asking the model question rather than only patching J.

### B20 — Mixed-side plain elements: main-field density (the B19 Leg B fix) ◐ OPEN 2026-07-18 (NEW, user-directed; executes the B19/GB19.6 finding)

**Trigger.** B19 Leg B (GB19.6) measured that on **mixed-side plain elements**
the residual takes its stiffness from the main field but its **density from the
side field**, and that this is not benign: the side field manufactures a
**spurious supersonic state** (q² 3.2229, M≈1.80, at the M_cap limiter) where
the main field reads 1.3379 (M≈1.16), with max density error **45.3 %** on the
252 aux-reading elements. The contamination reaches the SOLVER's density, not
just a diagnostic.

**★ The reporting layer already made this call.** `element_mach2` has carried
`mixed_plain="main"` as its DEFAULT since 2026-07-14 (user-arbitrated B8
backlog flip): the DIAGNOSTIC reads the main field for exactly this class,
calling the side reading a "×5 inflation … manufactured the LS tip exponent
p=+1.34 (honest +0.62)". **B20 makes the ASSEMBLY consistent with the
diagnostic** — a plain (single-valued, uncut) element is single-valued, so its
density belongs to the single-valued main field. The side-field substitution
only ever made sense for cut elements (which are genuinely two-valued and
assembled twice).

**Architecture — ★★ PERMANENT AND NON-OPTIONAL (user-arbitrated 2026-07-18).**
The fix was first built as a default-off `plain_density` knob so it could be
measured against the old behaviour (that A/B is the evidence below). **On the
strength of that evidence the user directed that it be hard-coded: no switch,
no default, no fallback.** The knob is REMOVED; mixed-side plain elements read
the main field unconditionally, at all three density sites
(`element_rho_tilde`, `newton_side_data`, `element_densities`) and in Leg A's
`_side_readvecs`.

**Why it is not a preference.** The decisive argument needs no physics: the
element's stiffness is contracted with the MAIN field (it scatters onto main
DOFs) while its density came from a DIFFERENT field — **one equation built from
two velocity fields, internally inconsistent**, regardless of which branch one
argues is "physically right". It is also uncut, so no jump passes through it.
And the reporting layer had already ruled the same way: `element_mach2` has
defaulted to `mixed_plain="main"` since 2026-07-14. B20 makes the ASSEMBLY
agree with the DIAGNOSTIC.

**Consequence, accepted with the decision:** the pre-B20 3-D level-set numbers
were solutions to a discretization carrying a known internal inconsistency.
They are re-based here; the old values stay traceable in git and in the
before/after CSVs.

- [x] **GB20.1 ✓ localized** (`results/legb_apply.csv`). Quasi-2-D NACA:
  `"main"` ≡ `"side"` **bit-identical (max|ΔR| = 0.000e+00)** — its 129
  mixed-side plain elements have **0** cut nodes, so main == side there.
  M6 coarse: R moves on **164 rows** (of 12k), 4 of them just outside the
  mixed-plain node set (legitimate Term-3 upstream coupling). ★ **A workspace
  aliasing bug was caught and fixed here first:** `PicardOperator.velocities`
  returns VIEWS into a shared buffer, so recomputing the main-field gradient
  clobbered the caller's side values in place — the first run moved 2940
  elements (not 129) and tripled subsonic Γ. Detaching with `.copy()` before
  the second `velocities` call fixed it; the 2940→164 drop is the tell.
  ★ *Caught by measuring an unexpected result, not by rationalizing it.*
- [x] **GB20.2 ✓ the Jacobian stays exact under `"main"`** — targeted probe
  **8.07e-09**, control **6.29e-10** (`results/legb_apply.csv`). Leg A composes
  with Leg B: under main density the mixed-plain columns return to main
  (`_side_readvecs` mode-aware) and the row/column gradient factors coincide,
  so J = dR/dφ still holds. The naive first cut (before the aliasing fix) read
  1.97e-02 — that was the same buffer bug, not a missing term.
- [x] **GB20.3 ✓ subsonic 2.5-D is UNAFFECTED** (`results/legb_subsonic_ab.csv`).
  NACA medium M0.5 embedded Γ **0.088144 → 0.088144 (+0.0000 %)**, wake-free
  0.088348 unchanged, B3 wake-free-vs-embedded 0.2313 % unchanged. Expected and
  honest: the quasi-2-D mesh has no aux-reading mixed-side plain elements (the
  class is a 3-D tip/junction phenomenon), so Leg B is a genuine no-op on every
  committed 2.5-D case. The change lives only in 3-D.
- [x] **GB20.4 ✓ transonic before/after — main density REACHES the target where
  side stalls** (`results/legb_transonic_ab.csv`, M6 coarse wing-alone ramp to
  M0.84): **side m_final 0.7875 NOT converged** (γ 0.077959, M_max 1.3157) vs
  **main m_final 0.84 CONVERGED** (γ 0.084812, M_max 1.4491). A genuine
  capability move on the wing-alone M6 coarse: removing the spurious-supersonic
  side-density contamination let the transonic ramp climb the last two levels
  and converge at the full target. (M_max is higher in main only because it is
  at M0.84 vs M0.7875 — a higher freestream, not a worse pocket.) Recorded as a
  positive signal, wing-alone/coarse; the wing-body medium is GB20.5.
- [x] **GB20.5 ✓ THE HYPOTHESIS TEST — a SPLIT result, and it is the most
  informative one** (`results/legb_b18_hypothesis.csv`, B18 medium LS wing-body,
  the side leg reproduces the committed baseline: side m_final 0.5, Mmax 3.920,
  nlim 42 / nflr 40, res 6.8e-5 ≈ committed 3.964 / 43 / 40).

  | | m_final | converged (res) | Mmax | nlim / nflr |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | side (committed) | 0.5 | **NO (6.8e-5)** | 3.920 | **42 / 40** |
  | main (Leg B) | 0.5 | **YES (1.1e-13)** | 5.220 | **3 / 3** |

  ★★ **The naive read — "Mmax 3.92 → 5.22, +33 %, worse" — is WRONG.** The side
  state is NOT converged: it churns at res 6.8e-5 with **82 cells on the
  limiter/floor**, so its 3.92 is a CLAMPED, propped-up value. The main state
  **converges to machine precision (1.1e-13) with only 6 clamped cells** — a
  genuine discrete solution.

  **So the hypothesis SPLITS in two, and both halves are findings:**
  - ★ **The CONVERGENCE pathology WAS substantially the mixed-plain side-density
    artifact.** B18's "dies at M0.5, 42/40 clamped, churns" is largely CURED by
    main density: res 6.8e-5 → **1.1e-13**, clamps 82 → **6**. The junction
    churn/limit-cycle that made the level-set wing-body untractable is, to a
    large degree, the spurious side-supersonic feedback GB19.6 measured.
  - ★ **The junction POCKET itself is REAL, and B19's literal hypothesis is
    REFUTED.** Removing the contamination did not remove the pocket — it
    UNCLAMPED it, revealing a genuine converged M≈5.2 spike at the wing-body
    junction (a subsonic-freestream local pocket = the G1.6/GB9.4 faceted-
    geometry discretization error, NOT the mixed-plain density). Main still
    cannot advance past M0.5.

  **Bottom line:** Leg B is not the cure for the junction pocket (that is
  geometry → curved elements, G1.6), but it IS a large part of the cure for the
  level-set wing-body's non-convergence. RECORDED, not pass/fail, as
  pre-registered. **Do not repeat "the pocket is mixed-plain contamination" —
  measured false.**
- [x] **GB20.6 ✓ full suite unchanged + adoption dossier delivered.** Suite
  **465 passed + 22 skipped + 2 xfailed** (1112.37 s @16) — identical to the
  B19 baseline, as `plain_density="side"` default requires. The knob is inert
  until someone asks for it.

  **Adoption dossier (the decision is the user's; NOT flipped here).**

  | evidence | side (today) | main (Leg B) |
  |---|---|---|
  | 2.5-D subsonic Γ (B3/B4) | 0.088144 | **0.088144 — no-op** |
  | M6 coarse ramp → M0.84 | m 0.7875, **not converged** | **M0.84, converged** |
  | B18 wing-body medium @M0.5 | res 6.8e-5, **82 clamped** | **res 1.1e-13, 6 clamped** |
  | B18 junction Mmax | 3.920 (clamped) | 5.220 (genuine, unclamped) |
  | Jacobian exactness | exact (B19) | **exact** (8.07e-09) |

  **The case FOR adopting `main` as default:**
  1. ★ **It is the principled model, not a tuning choice.** A plain element is
     uncut and single-valued; reading its density from a side field that
     imports the OTHER side of the wake is simply wrong. The reporting layer
     already made this exact call in 2026-07-14 (`element_mach2`'s
     `mixed_plain="main"` default) — adoption makes assembly and diagnostic
     agree instead of contradicting each other.
  2. Every committed **2.5-D** result is bit-identical (the class is 3-D only),
     so B3/B4/B6/B11–B17's quasi-2-D locks do not move at all.
  3. It **improves 3-D convergence** materially (M6 coarse reaches the target;
     the wing-body converges to machine precision instead of churning).
  4. The Jacobian stays exact, so B19's work composes.

  **The cost / what it does NOT buy:**
  - It **re-bases the 3-D committed level-set numbers** (M6 transonic γ/M_max
    in B7/B15, and the B9-LS / B16 / B17 / B18 wing-body values). Regenerating
    that committed evidence is hours of heavy compute — the real price.
  - It does **NOT** fix the junction pocket (GB20.5: real, G1.6-class geometry).
  - The M6 coarse γ moves 0.0780 → 0.0848 (+8.8 %) with no independent
    reference to say which is closer to truth; "converges to the target" is an
    objective improvement, "more accurate" is NOT claimed.

#### B20 re-baseline of the committed 3-D level-set evidence (2026-07-19)

Making the fix permanent re-bases the 3-D level-set numbers. **Scope, measured
rather than assumed:** the default suite is **465+22+2 unchanged** and the
gated 3-D LS tests are **67/67 green** — *no test lock breaks at all*.

★ **Why the suite could not see it, and that is itself a gap:** the 3-D numbers
are not locked by tests, they live in demo evidence. B15's tests, for instance,
run entirely on the 2.5-D NACA mesh (which B20 provably cannot touch), while
its M6-medium γ = 0.088338 is a *demo* number no test asserts. Same shape as
B19's blind spot, one layer out: **a change that moves 3-D level-set physics
raises no alarm in the suite.** Recorded as an open process gap.

★ **Demo-cache trap (cost me one false "regenerated" result):** the heavy demos
cache solves to gitignored `results/*.npz` and a plain re-run silently REUSES
them. B7's first "re-run" reported 35 passed with one punctuation diff — it was
`[M1] cached / [M4] cached`. Correct procedure: **delete the level-set `.npz`
first, then verify the log contains zero `cached` lines.** Conforming caches
may legitimately stay (B20 cannot touch that path).

**What actually moved.**

*Unchanged:* all 2.5-D; the whole conforming path; **B9's cross-model headline
(LS cl_p 0.2165 / cl_kj 0.2175 — not one digit)**; B17's triangle
(0.2115→0.2114); the gate verdicts of B9, B16, B17, B18.

*Improved — every one in the direction B20 predicts:*

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| B7 M6 M0.84 M_max | 1.453 | **1.392** |
| B7 tip Γ(z)→0 | −0.0003 | **−0.0000** |
| B16 coarse legacy limited cells | **3690** | **11** |
| B16 coarse pin floored cells | 3 | **0** |
| B16 medium pin clamps | 42/40 churn | **0/0** |
| B18 wing-body medium residual | 6.8e-5 | **1.1e-13** |
| M6 coarse ramp → M0.84 | 0.7875, not converged | **0.84, converged** |

★ B16's `flr 3 → 0` is worth naming: those three floored cells were recorded in
B16 as "the B8/G1.6 junction class, orthogonal to the BC fix, not chased". They
were this contamination.

*Regressed — ONE case:* **M6 medium M0.84** (B15's committed recipe; B14 fails
with it because it asserts the same GB15.4 physics). The ramp reaches
**M0.6625 (2/5 levels)** where it used to reach M0.84; γ 0.088338 → 0.071909.
B15 now scores 17/20, B14 5/7, and **every failing check in both traces to this
one case**.

★★ **A finding that changes how the old number reads.** B15's gate compared
M_max against `PICARD_M6 = dict(..., m_max=2.4549)` — the LS **Picard**. Both
LS solvers read the same contaminated density, so **that check was common-mode:
it verified the two LS solvers agreed with each other, never that M_max was
right.** The conforming record on M6 medium is **1.995**; the old LS 2.45–2.49
sat well above it. Separately, the new M_max 1.5822 is measured at **M0.6625,
not M0.84** — different freestream, not a like-for-like number, so that FAIL is
downstream of the reach failure, not an independent finding. **The real
regression is one clause: the ramp no longer reaches M0.84 on this mesh.**

- [x] **GB20.7 — ANSWERED: a REAL capability loss, not a recipe mismatch**
  (`results/gb207_recipe_sweep.csv`, 2026-07-19). `freeze_tol` swept 1e-3 →
  1e-6 on the committed M6-medium call:

  | freeze_tol | m_final | levels | accept routes |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | 1e-3 (committed) | 0.6625 | 2/5 | assignment_cycle |
  | 1e-4 | 0.6625 | 2/5 | assignment_cycle |
  | **1e-5** | **0.6750** | **3/6** | + **tol** |
  | 1e-6 | 0.6750 | 3/6 | + tol |

  ★ **The hypothesis was directionally right and quantitatively insufficient.**
  Lowering `freeze_tol` does help — the ceiling moves 0.6625 → 0.6750 and a
  level starts converging on `tol` instead of escaping via `assignment_cycle`,
  confirming 1e-3 was indeed calibrated above a churn floor that B20 lowered.
  But the ceiling moves by 0.0125, not to 0.84. **The recipe was a contributor,
  not the cause.**
  **Honest bound:** only `freeze_tol` was varied (`dm`, `n_newton_max`,
  `m_start` were not), so this is the evidence-based conclusion, not a proof
  that no recipe can reach M0.84.

  ★★ **Synthesis — the contamination was acting as an unintended stabiliser.**
  The same pattern appears on the wing-body (GB20.5): with the contamination
  removed the solver converges *beautifully* (0/0 clamps, |R| ~1e-13) but
  cannot climb as far. Before B20 the M6-medium ramp reached M0.84 — into a
  state whose M_max 2.45–2.49 sits ~25 % above the conforming reference
  (**1.995**) and was only ever validated against the equally-contaminated LS
  Picard. **The trade is real and should be stated as a trade:** the old code
  went further into states we now have reason to distrust; the new code stops
  earlier and what it produces is clean.

  **Post-B20 level-set transonic envelope (M6 wake-free):** coarse **M0.84
  converged** (an improvement — it was 0.7875 not-converged), medium **≈M0.675**
  (was M0.84). ⇒ **GB15.4's "reaches M0.84" clause is now a NEGATIVE and
  B14's "== the committed GB15.4 physics" clause is superseded**; both need a
  re-spec against the new envelope (the G14.7 precedent: re-lock against what
  is now the honest oracle). Left OPEN for the user rather than re-specced
  unilaterally, since it redefines a committed capability claim. Evidence points at mismatch but does not prove it: **0/0 clamped
  at every level including the failed ones**, |R| 9.2e-14 where it converges,
  freeze armed every level with zero reverts, converged levels accepted via
  `assignment_cycle` (the intrinsic discretization floor). It is not diverging
  and not being clamped — it simply cannot climb on the now-clean field, and
  B15's recipe was calibrated against the contaminated one (B18 has the
  precedent: the wing-body needed `freeze_tol` 1e-6→1e-5). **Decider:** a
  targeted recalibration (raise `freeze_tol`, adjust `dm`). Reaching M0.84
  again ⇒ mismatch; failing under every reasonable recipe ⇒ a real capability
  loss the user must weigh against the gains above.

★ **Backport check (the A3 rule):** the conforming path has no side/aux DOFs
and no mixed-side plain class, so there is nothing to backport — recorded, not
skipped.

byte-untouched. Sequencing guard: P8's Newton landed on the conforming wake
(closed), and a level-set Newton is a post-B6 re-derivation (simpler — the
wake-LS Jacobian blocks are constant in φ, no Γ elimination/Woodbury); Track B
blocks nothing in P7–P12, and M2 (wing-body) wants it.

| B20 | ✓ | 2026-07-18 | **Mixed-side plain elements now read their density from the MAIN field — PERMANENTLY, with no switch (user-arbitrated).** Executes GB19.6. ★★ **Why it is not optional:** the element's stiffness is contracted with the MAIN field (it scatters onto main DOFs) while its density came from a DIFFERENT field — **one equation built from two velocity fields, internally inconsistent** — and the element is UNCUT, so no wake jump passes through it at all. That argument needs no physics and admits no "preference" reading. ★ **The reporting layer had already ruled the same way** — `element_mach2` has defaulted to `mixed_plain="main"` since 2026-07-14 — so B20 makes the ASSEMBLY agree with the DIAGNOSTIC. The fix was first built as a default-off `plain_density` knob purely to measure the A/B below; on that evidence the user directed it be hard-coded and the knob REMOVED. ★★ **A workspace-aliasing bug was caught by measuring an unexpected result:** `PicardOperator.velocities` returns VIEWS into a shared buffer, so recomputing the main gradient inside the density path overwrote the caller's side values in place — quasi-2D "moved" 0.77, subsonic Γ tripled, the Jacobian degraded: all ONE bug (2940 elements clobbered vs the 129 in the mask), fixed with `.copy()`. *Accepting the plausible "Γ tripled ⇒ big effect" story would have recorded an aliasing bug as a physics finding.* **GB20.1 ✓** quasi-2D bit-identical (0.000e+00), M6 R moves on 164 of ~12k rows. **GB20.2 ✓** the Jacobian stays EXACT (targeted 8.07e-09 / control 6.29e-10; the gated 3-D FD gate passes 3/3 post-permanence) — B19 Leg A ∘ B20 compose. **GB20.3 ✓** 2.5-D subsonic Γ 0.088144 → 0.088144 (**+0.0000 %**): the class is 3-D only, so every committed quasi-2D lock is untouched. **GB20.4 ✓** M6 coarse ramp→M0.84: old **m 0.7875 NOT converged** → new **M0.84 CONVERGED** (γ 0.0780→0.0848; "converges to target" is the objective gain, "more accurate" is NOT claimed — no independent reference). **GB20.5 ✓ RECORDED — the hypothesis SPLITS.** B18 medium wing-body @M0.5: old res 6.8e-5 / **82 clamped** / Mmax 3.920 (a CLAMPED, NON-converged number) → new **res 1.1e-13 / 6 clamped** / Mmax 5.220 (a genuine converged solution). ⇒ ★ the **CONVERGENCE** pathology was largely this contamination (B18's churn/clamping substantially cured), but ★ the junction **POCKET is REAL** and B19's literal hypothesis is **REFUTED** — removing the contamination UNCLAMPED it, revealing a genuine M≈5.2 spike at subsonic freestream = the **G1.6/GB9.4 faceted-geometry** error, not the mixed-plain density. It still cannot pass M0.5. **Do not repeat "the pocket is mixed-plain contamination" — measured false.** **Accepted cost:** the pre-B20 3-D level-set numbers were solutions to a discretization carrying a known internal inconsistency and are re-based; old values stay traceable in git and in the before/after CSVs. The three A/B scripts are marked HISTORICAL (the knob they toggle is gone; reproduce at commit 5369a84); the standing Jacobian check is `tests/test_b19_jacobian_3d.py`.

| B19 | ✓ | 2026-07-18 | **The LS-Newton Jacobian is now exact in 3-D (Leg A), and the residual's own asymmetry is measured and routed (Leg B).** Executes the A3/GA3.6 C1 finding; opened + closed same day, user-directed, two deliberately separated legs. **★ Leg A was TWO defects, not one.** (1) **DOF maps**: Terms 2/3 used the mass-conservation SCATTER map for both rows and columns, but the columns must follow `side_potentials`' per-node READ map — they coincide on cut elements (asserted: `readvec` reproduces `dofs_upper`/`dofs_lower`) and diverge on mixed-side plain elements, a 3-D-only class. (2) **Gradient factors, the same duality one level down**: the residual is `rho_tilde(grad of the READ field) * V * (grad of the SCATTER field . B_a)`, so the ROW factor must use `grad_row` while the COLUMN factor keeps the side gradient; the code used the side gradient for both. ★ Fixing (1) alone left the probe at **1.4697e-02** — 8× better but **still ε-independent** ⇒ recorded PARTIAL instead of rounded into a pass, which is what forced (2) out. ★ A column-wise FD localization plus a block isolation (`\|FD23−J23\| ≡ \|FD23−J2\|` exactly ⇒ Term 3 contributes nothing there) found (2) — **the first reading of the row classification had pointed at Term 3 and was wrong**; acting on it would have put a new bug into correct code. **GB19.1 ✓** targeted probe **1.145684e-01 → 1.333699e-08**, control 6.327479e-10 unchanged, global-free 2.47e-03 → 8.49e-10; ★★ **the ε discriminator FLIPPED** — pre-fix 1.532e-01 at every ε (spread 1.00 = a missing term), post-fix 1.6e-09/2.1e-08/2.2e-07 (spread 131.5, ~1/ε = pure FD roundoff): an ε-independent error became ε-sensitive, the transition a real fix must produce and one no tolerance-loosening can fake. **GB19.2 ✓** `max\|ΔR\| = **0.000e+00**` bit-identical on a 3-D mesh, verified by `git stash` A/B after EACH fix ⇒ no converged level-set result can move; asserted, not inferred. **GB19.4 ✓ RECORDED NEGATIVE — the fix buys NO convergence**: pre/post 40 steps, not converged, γ **0.07212068** identical to 8 dp, M_max **1.134235** to 6 dp, same plateau (residuals differ only by limit-cycle phase), **+3.6 % wall** for the extra einsum. The plateau is the **B15 selection-churn limit cycle** (0 limited/0 floored, clean period) and an exact derivative cannot fix a discontinuous selection — **the phase must not be credited with a convergence improvement**; what it buys is correctness (a Newton method rather than a quasi-Newton). **GB19.5 ✓** `tests/test_b19_jacobian_3d.py` (+3: gated 3-D FD gate + 2 structural locks) closes the blind spot that let this live through B6–B18; ★★ **ERRATUM: the blind spot was mis-stated** by the C1 write-up AND by this author's first test — quasi-2-D has **129** mixed-side plain elements, not zero; what it has zero of is the subset that can READ an aux (**0 of 129 touch a cut node**), which is the real invariant. **GB19.6 ✓ (Leg B) — the residual's asymmetry is NOT benign.** Zero-change probe: only **252** elements (**0.1888 %** of volume) actually read an aux, but there max\|ρ_side − ρ_main\| = **0.4474 (45.3 %)**, 154/39 of 252 differ >1 %/>10 %, and decisively **the SIDE field reads q² up to 3.2229 (M≈1.80, at the M_cap limiter) where the MAIN field reads 1.3379** — a **spurious supersonic state** that the artificial-density switch then acts on, i.e. the contamination reaches the solver's density, not just a diagnostic. ★ Third bite from one element class (B8's ×5 `element_mach2` metric artifact → A3/B19 Jacobian → now the residual). ★ **HYPOTHESIS, not a result:** a candidate contributor to B18's refinement-worsening wing-body pocket (M_max artifact 3.96); measured on wing-alone M6, no causal link shown; named test = rerun B18 medium LS with main-field density and see if 3.96 moves. **NOT adopted** — changing the density source changes R and moves every converged answer ⇒ its own phase.

| B1 | ✓ | 2026-07-11 | **B1 delivery (2026-07-11):** `pyfp3d/wake/levelset.py` (TE-**polyline** ruled straight wake per design_track_b.md D9, per-segment frames, `update_direction()` re-aims the wake without touching the mesh) + `pyfp3d/wake/cut_elements.py` (ε side-shift relative to local edge length (D4), **downstream-crossing test** excluding the ahead-of-LE sign-change region, TE-node flagging, below-TE fan recorded as `te_lower_elems` for B2's López-fig-3.6c aux assignment, per-node ext DOFs, López eq. 3.33–3.34 `dofs_upper`/`dofs_lower` tables); imported by nothing in the shipped solver paths. Gate evidence (`tests/test_b1_cut_elements.py`, **34 passed**, the FULL dual-mesh matrix — 2.5D M0/M3 coarse+medium AND 3D M1/M4 ONERA M6): M0 embedded — every conforming sheet node ε-shifted "+" (the D4 stress test at scale), census cross-validated EXACTLY against `cut_wake` (`cut_elems ∪ te_lower_elems` == the minus-side element star, element-by-element), TE nodes == `wc.te_nodes`; M3 wake-free — generic cuts, gap-free corridor TE→far field at α=0 AND re-aimed to α=4° **on the same mesh**; M1/M4 ONERA M6 — census a strict **superset** of the conforming minus-star (0 missing, +2.9% tip-edge straddlers: expected, since in an embedded method the sheet's tip EDGE need not conform), spanwise clip verified. ★ **Two 3D-only mechanisms found and fixed here** (both invisible on quasi-2D meshes): (1) the swept TE span axis is NOT perpendicular to the wake direction ⇒ q must come from the **oblique (v, d̂, n̂) frame** — an orthogonal projection leaks the downstream distance into the spanwise coordinate and wrongly clipped ~60% of the true M6 cut set (measured, fixed, regression-pinned); (2) the **spanwise clip** (crossings must satisfy 0 ≤ q ≤ span_length) is mandatory — without it the level set cuts the wake-plane extension beyond the tip, i.e. P5's far-field branch-ray artifact re-created (the conforming path gets the same semantics from its free-edge rule, Γ(tip)=0). Suite **218+8+2** (was 184+8+2; +34, some of which skip when the gitignored wake-free meshes aren't generated locally); conforming solver paths byte-untouched; all runs at the 8-thread cap alongside the in-flight P9 fine demo. |
| B2 | ✓ | 2026-07-11 | **B2 delivery (2026-07-11):** multivalued (CutFEM-style) FE assembly. `pyfp3d/kernels/cut_assembly.py` (`multivalued_redirection_coo` + `continuity_closure_coo`) + `pyfp3d/wake/multivalued.py::MultivaluedOperator` (extended n_total = n_main + n_ext DOF assembly, TE-jump/Γ extraction) + `pyfp3d/solve/picard_ls.py::solve_multivalued_laplace` (non-lifting direct-LU driver, parallel to the conforming path). **Key simplification (design_track_b.md §2.5/D6):** a cut element is the same P1 element matrix assembled twice with B1's `dofs_upper`/`dofs_lower`; expressed as a sparse redirection of the single-valued matrix — only the entries whose two nodes are on OPPOSITE sides move their column main(b)→aux(b), everything else byte-identical to `PicardOperator.assemble_matrix()`. Aux rows carry the B2 continuity ("weld") closure aux_k = main_j, so the extended system reduces EXACTLY to the single-valued one (`test_extended_matrix_folds_to_stiffness`: fold recovers the stiffness matrix to 1e-13). Extended matrix is nonsymmetric ⇒ `spsolve`; GMRES+AMG deferred to B3+ scaling (design_track_b.md §5.3). Gate (`tests/test_b2_multivalued.py`, **17 passed**, coarse+medium both 2.5D families + 3D M6 coarse both families; medium/M6 skip in CI where gitignored): V0 freestream **0.0** (2.5D, α=0/4°) / **1e-14** (3D M6) < 1e−12; V1 MMS slope **1.94** ≥ 1.9 (generic-position cube cut); Laplace α=0 ⇒ TE jump = 0, cl_KJ = 0, main φ == single-valued oracle to **3e-11**. Suite **235+8+2** (was 218+8+2; +17, some medium/M6 skip in CI — the B2 commit message's "229" was measured before the medium parametrization was added, corrected 2026-07-12); conforming solver paths byte-untouched; 8-thread cap. Next = B3 (implicit Kutta: g₁+g₂ wake LS replaces the weld). |
| B3 | ✓ | 2026-07-12 | **B3 CLOSED (with B4).** Lifting solve with implicit Kutta on the level-set path: no Γ secant, no master–slave Γ — the TE jump is carried by the multivalued aux DOFs, the g₁+g₂ wake LS convects it, and its VALUE comes from B4's nonlinear TE pressure-equality Kutta. Γ is a RESULT. Delivered: `kernels/cut_assembly.py` (`mass_conservation_coo` per-side ρ per D10, `wake_ls_coo`, `te_kutta_coo`), `wake/multivalued.py` (`closure="wake_ls"`, side potentials/densities, TE control volumes), `solve/picard_ls.py::solve_multivalued_lifting`. Far field = freestream + vortex on the **MAIN** DOFs, aux **FREE**. Gate (`tests/test_b3_lifting.py`, **6 passed**): V3 M0.5 α=2° cl_KJ **0.2828** (medium) INSIDE the committed [PG 0.2788, KT 0.2919] bracket (read from `cases/reference_data/naca0012_m05/cl_reference.csv`), on BOTH the wake-embedded M0 and the **wake-free M3** families; same-mesh A/B vs conforming Γ within **0.1–0.7%** at M=0 and M=0.5 (0.1177/0.1191/0.1197 vs 0.1175/0.1200/0.1202 on coarse/medium/fine); the **wake-free** mesh (no `wake` tag, generic cuts — the workflow form) reproduces the embedded-mesh Γ to **0.3%**; the wake jump is CONVECTED, not decaying. **Five correctness fixes landed here (all load-bearing):** (1) far-field **aux DOFs must stay FREE** (Neumann) — pinning them to the vortex lower branch drains the circulation (jump decays 0.0147→0.001); the vortex goes on the **main** DOFs only. (2) The wake must be **coplanar with the vortex branch cut** (chord plane y=0, design.md §4) — aiming the level set along the freestream while the branch cut stays horizontal leaves an unsupported Dirichlet jump at the outlet ⇒ spurious velocity ⇒ density blow-up (all high-M cells at x≈15, NaNs). (3) The per-side cut-strip density **limit-cycles and must be under-relaxed** (`omega_rho`, default 0.5); full adoption diverges after ~80 outers (Γ 0.126→0.010, M_max→6.7). (4) **D11 is mandatory**: wall Cp from `phi_main` makes lower-surface TE triangles reference the TE's UPPER value ⇒ cl_pressure = **−3.35** (junk); the per-side `phi_up`/`phi_lo` mapping brings cl_p within 0.4% of cl_KJ. (5) **Compressibility is carried by the BULK density, NOT the far-field vortex** — PG-scaling the vortex (β<1) leaves Γ unchanged, while the bulk density raises it 0.1086→0.1256 (the correct 1/β direction). |
| B4 | ✓ | 2026-07-12 | **B4 NEW + CLOSED same day (user-directed) — TE control-volume / implicit-Kutta re-derivation.** The B3 blocker was that the emergent Γ converged to the WRONG value (0.2074/0.1760/0.1704 vs conforming 0.1175/0.1200/0.1202 — mesh-convergent ⇒ a METHOD defect, +42%). **Root cause, two structural facts:** (1) **the wake LS CANNOT pin Γ** — its residual is identically zero for any spatially-constant jump because Σ_c ∇N_c = ∇(1) = 0 (partition of unity), measured **1.9e-16** ⇒ design_track_b.md §2.3/D2's "g₂ IS the discrete Kutta condition" is **FALSE and retired** (the López dissertation has no explicit Kutta anywhere — the word never appears in its method chapter); (2) Γ was therefore pinned by a single, WRONG equation — the TE aux row (lower-side mass conservation), whose control volume is up/down **asymmetric** on a symmetric airfoil (TE fan 9 upper / 6 lower / 3 cut, because the ε shift sends every on-sheet node "+"). **★ Fix = the NONLINEAR TE pressure-equality (Bernoulli) Kutta.** Symmetrizing the control volume is NOT available (the mesh is naturally asymmetric at the TE — user-arbitrated 2026-07-12), so the condition is a POINTWISE PHYSICAL statement needing no symmetry: |q_u|² = |q_l|², factorized **exactly** as (q_u+q_l)·(q_u−q_l)=0 and linearized by freezing the mean s̄ = q_u+q_l at the previous iterate ⇒ a row LINEAR in φ, re-linearized each Picard outer (same cadence as the density lag — no new outer loop) and converging to the exact nonlinear condition. It replaces the TE **aux** row; the displaced lower-side mass-conservation entries are re-routed onto the TE **main** row, which then carries the TOTAL (upper+lower) balance, so mass stays conserved and no side is arbitrarily robbed of its equation. **Why it is non-degenerate where g₂ is not:** q_u and q_l are recovered on DIFFERENT element sets, so q_u−q_l is NOT a jump gradient and does not vanish for a constant jump. **★ The control volumes must be WALL-ADJACENT** (elements carrying a wall face = the upper/lower body surface at the TE), not the whole fan — the Kutta condition is about SURFACE velocities: full-fan recovery gives Γ 0.1407/0.1355/0.1329 (+11–15%, interior and wake elements pollute the average), wall-adjacent gives **0.1177/0.1191/0.1197** (**<1%** of conforming). **The D2 penalty-Kutta fallback is no longer needed** — no penalty weight, no tuning parameter (s̄ is solved for, not calibrated). Also fixed en route: the ε shift was manufacturing **spurious cuts in the below-TE fan** (3 of 6 elements got a bogus UPPER copy BELOW the wake) — exactly the López p.57 warning; that fix alone restored mesh convergence (Γ went from a mesh-independent wrong 0.186 to the convergent 0.207→0.176→0.170). Gate (`tests/test_b4_te_control_volume.py`, **8 passed**, ~29 s): LS null space pinned (1.9e-16); TE control volumes wall-adjacent; below-TE fan never cut; **emergent Γ within 5% of conforming (measured 0.1–0.7%)** while the old `te_kutta="mass"` row is still >30% out; visual artifact `artifacts/EXPORT_TE_DIAGNOSIS/b4_te_kutta.png`. Interfaces: `solve_multivalued_lifting(..., te_kutta="pressure")` (default), `te_kutta="mass"` retained for the before/after contrast. |
| B5 | ✓ | 2026-07-12 | (was B4.5, orig B3.5) **NEW 2026-07-11 + CLOSED 2026-07-12 (user-arbitrated) — far-field A/B: option a (Dirichlet+vortex) STAYS the default.** `solve_multivalued_lifting` grew `farfield="vortex"` (default, option a: spherical Dirichlet freestream + PG vortex on the MAIN DOFs with the emergent Γ refreshed in each outer iter, aux FREE) / `"neumann"` (option b, López: inflow Dirichlet freestream + outflow Neumann outlet carrying the freestream flux ρ∞(u·n̂), NO vortex, NO Γ feedback) / `"freestream"` (Dirichlet freestream everywhere, crudest).

Both families bit-for-bit agree. ⇒ option a stays default (compact 15c workflow); option b validated but domain-hungry. **M6 leg folded into B7** (the 3D B-path solve is B7 machinery; the span-uniform option-a vortex also recreates the P5 branch-ray artifact on M6 without the Γ(z) taper — B7).

The conforming path runs a separate secant PER TE STATION (the machinery whose single-station failure, st133, cost P5 a whole investigation, and whose jitter `INVESTIGATION_gamma_smoothing.md` failed to smooth away); the implicit Kutta has no per-station loop — Γ is ONE solution mode ⇒ the P5 spanwise-Γ problem is not fixed but made **structurally impossible**. **★ The 3D-only machinery needed NO new solver code** (B1's oblique-frame + spanwise-clip fixes held): Γ(tip) → ~3e-4 discretely; the only gap was post-processing (`post/surface_ls.py`: `section_cp_curve_levelset` + `cl_pressure_3d_levelset`). Cost far under the risk estimate (~0.6 s/outer at ~12k 3D DOFs ⇒ ~20 min/solve, not hours). **Caveats (recorded, not chased):** top Mach levels park on the P4/B6 Picard residual tail (|R| ~4–6e-6, 600-outer cap) — bounded + physical + in band at every level, so the gate asserts *bounded*, not `converged`; **LS Newton on M6 deferred** (plain splu; P8/N6's true-3D LU fill ⇒ needs lagged-LU); shocks sit 0.02–0.04c aft of P5 (in band) and η=0.90 is 0.087 aft of the P8 Newton shock.

Fix = a convex BLEND per TE node of the pressure-equality row with B2's continuity weld: `F·[s·(q_u−q_l)] + (1−F)·[φ_aux−φ_main] = 0` (F=1 inboard ⇒ pressure Kutta bit-identical; F=0 at tip ⇒ weld ⇒ jump=0 ⇒ tip unloaded).

Triangle then closes MONOTONE to conforming (cl_p wing): coarse conf 0.2089 / legacy 0.1853 / pin0 0.2086 / **pin_gamma 0.2087**; medium conf 0.2173 / legacy 0.2165 / pin0 0.1690 / **pin_gamma 0.2117 (Picard) = 0.2115 (Newton)** — both solvers agree 0.1%, undershoot conforming 0.1%/2.6% (far-field truncation). **GB17.1 ✓** ring jump collapses legacy 53.4 → pin 0 → pin_gamma 0.063=γ; coarse legacy garbage (|jump|=53) IS a 12% deficit ⇒ **B9 "coarse 12.8% = resolution" was contamination** (erratum added). **GB17.2 ✓** cl_p (surface integral) and cl_KJ (circulation) move together ⇒ the gap is a flow-state change NOT a post artifact; the user's "Cp aligns yet cl_p differs" is a Cp-axis scale illusion, and the plotted sectional cl(z) is Γ-based `2Γ/(u·c)`. **GB17.3 ✓** pin jump=0 = BC error, both solvers 0.169. **GB17.4 ✓** pin_gamma closes triangle (Newton≈Picard <1%, monotone). **GB17.5** spanwise Γ(z) uniform offset removed (RECORDED). **GB17.6** vortex does NOT close the gap — BRACKETS conforming from above (medium +2.5% vs pin_gamma −2.6%) and churns at coarse (free aux); freestream pin_gamma stays recommended (RECORDED, user-requested). ★ **B16 conflated two orthogonal issues** — far-field near-singular *conditioning* (pin cures, jump value irrelevant) vs outflow *circulation* (needs jump=γ); the wing-fuselage-junction churn (nlim 42/nflr 40 at medium, G1.6/GB9.4 class) survives but limits only the residual floor, not the lift. **Defaults (user-arbitrated):** `pin_gamma` new default on BOTH solvers, acts only on freestream, inert (bit-identical to legacy) on vortex/neumann ⇒ every committed 2.5D vortex/neumann Picard + neumann Newton anchor byte-untouched; B9/B16 freestream Picard demos pinned to explicit `legacy`; B16 jump=0 reproduces with explicit `"pin"`.

| B18 | ✓ | 2026-07-18 | (NEW 2026-07-18, user-directed; appended after B17, no renumber; executes the GB16.6 debt) **Wing-body transonic (M0.84) — conforming reaches it, level-set is junction-limited.** The capability is asymmetric and that IS the finding. **Conforming** (Newton + pressure Kutta, Mach continuation) is the wing-body transonic path: **coarse M0.84 cl_p 0.2617** (Mmax 2.15, strict), **medium M0.79 cl_p 0.2579** strict (res 2.2e-14), clean cl_p(M) rise **0.2173/0.2321/0.2579** at M0.50/0.65/0.79; medium **M0.80+ stalls** (res ~2e-6, 0 clamp — NOT slivers: medium mesh clean 0-tets<5°, coarse has 27 yet reaches 0.84; a sharper shock/junction interaction, recorded not chased). ★ recipe: the conforming wing-body medium ramp needs `freeze_tol` raised to the wing-body churn floor (1e-6→1e-5, the B17 lesson) or it stalls at M0.80. **Level-set** (B15 freeze-ramp + B17 pin_gamma) does NOT reach transonic on the wing-body: the wing-fuselage junction spurious supersonic pocket (**G1.6/GB9.4/B8 mixed-plain**, M²≈1.27 already at M0.5) **WORSENS with refinement** — coarse ceiling **M0.575** (Mmax 1.44), medium dies at the FIRST transonic level ~**M0.5** (Mmax artifact 3.96, nlim 43/nflr 40); the direct analogue of GB9.4's fuselage-lift-grows-with-refinement. Closed-negative discretization error (discipline #8), characterized not chased. ⇒ **no common transonic Mach at medium** (LS can't leave 0.5), so the trustworthy cross-model stays M0.5 (2.6%, B9/B17); a coarse M0.60 transonic cross-model was skipped (LS coarse ceiling 0.575<0.60). **GB18.1 ✓ PASS** (conforming transonic). **GB18.2/3/4/5 RECORDED** (LS ceiling; cross-model M0.5-only; junction worsens with refinement coarse Mmax 1.4→medium 4.0; fuselage lift 16% of wing @M0.79, GB9.4 class). ★ **repays the GB16.6 evidence debt** (spec'd RECORDED but never implemented; B18 executes it as a negative). ★ **NO pyfp3d/ numerics change** — pure demo/tests/docs on existing `solve_newton_transonic` + `solve_multivalued_newton_transonic`. fine excluded (G13.3).
